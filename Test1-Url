Gintonin is a novel ginseng-derived lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor ligand. Oral administration of gintonin ameliorates learning and memory dysfunctions in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) animal models. The brain cholinergic system plays a key role in cognitive functions. The brains of AD patients show a reduction in acetylcholine concentration caused by cholinergic system impairments. However, little is known about the role of LPA in the cholinergic system. In this study, we used gintonin to investigate the effect of LPA receptor activation on the cholinergic system in vitro and in vivo using wild-type and AD animal models. Gintonin induced [Ca2+]i transient in cultured mouse hippocampal neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Gintonin-mediated [Ca2+]i transients were linked to stimulation of acetylcholine release through LPA receptor activation. Oral administration of gintonin-enriched fraction (25, 50, or 100 mg/kg, 3 weeks) significantly attenuated scopolamine-induced memory impairment. Oral administration of gintonin (25 or 50 mg/kg, 2 weeks) also significantly attenuated amyloid-β protein (Aβ)-induced cholinergic dysfunctions, such as decreased acetylcholine concentration, decreased choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity and immunoreactivity, and increased acetylcholine esterase (AChE) activity. In a transgenic AD mouse model, long-term oral administration of gintonin (25 or 50 mg/kg, 3 months) also attenuated AD-related cholinergic impairments. In this study, we showed that activation of G protein-coupled LPA receptors by gintonin is coupled to the regulation of cholinergic functions. Furthermore, this study showed that gintonin could be a novel agent for the restoration of cholinergic system damages due to Aβ and could be utilized for AD prevention or therapy.

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common age-associated neurodegenerative disease (Alzheimer, 1907). It is characterized clinically by progressive memory impairment and deterioration of other cognitive functions (Van Der Flier et al., 2002). Neuropathological hallmarks of AD include senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in neocortical and limbic brain lesions, which are coupled with neuronal loss or dysfunction (Braak et al., 1986). The formation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are well characterized in AD neuropathy. Senile plaques contain amyloid-β protein (Aβ) (Yankner, 1996). Aβ is produced from the amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP) via amyloidogenic proteolytic cleavage pathways (Vassar et al., 1999). Another important phenomenon in AD is the dysfunction of the cholinergic system by amyloid plaques in several brain areas such as the basal forebrain, cortical regions, and the hippocampus. The loss of cholinergic neurons in the brain is closely associated with the reduction of acetylcholine synthesis; this is known as the cholinergic hypothesis of AD (Bartus et al., 1982).

Ginseng and ginkgo or ginseng extracts increased acetylcholine release (Liu et al., 2004; Su et al., 2007) and enhanced cognitive performance in human and AD patients (Heo et al., 2008; Kennedy and Scholey, 2003; Lee et al., 2008). However, relatively little is known about the active ingredient of ginseng and its signaling mechanisms. In our previous work, we showed that ginseng contains a novel G protein-coupled lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor ligand, gintonin (Hwang et al., 2012a; Pyo et al., 2011). Gintonin enhanced synaptic transmission in hippocampal slices through LPA receptor signaling pathways (Park et al., 2015). We showed that gintonin is the active component of ginseng to attenuate AD-related neuropathies via activation of non-amyloidogenic pathways; gintonin significantly improved Aβ-induced cognitive dysfunctions in mice. In addition, long-term oral administration of gintonin attenuated amyloid plaque deposition in the hippocampus as well as short- and long-term memory impairment in a transgenic AD mouse model (Hwang et al., 2012b).

LPA receptors play an important role in learning and memory functions in aged animals. For example, LPAR1-null mice exhibited impaired performances in hippocampus-mediated spatial memory and cognitive tests (Castilla-Ortega et al., 2010; 2011; 2012; Dash et al., 2004). LPAR1-null mice also showed impaired fear extinction (Pedraza et al., 2014). Thus, although the previous reports showed that ginseng extract could induce acetylcholine release and improve cognitive functions in human and AD patients (Heo et al., 2008; Kennedy and Scholey, 2003; Lee et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2004; Su et al., 2007) and that LPA treatment to embryonic neural stem cells cultured stimulates the differentiation to cholinergic neurons (Cui and Qiao, 2006), it was not shown whether gintonin affects the cholinergic system through LPA receptors or whether activation of the LPA receptor by gintonin exhibits ameliorating effects on the cholinergic system impaired by scopolamine, by Aβ-infusion into the brain, and in a transgenic AD mouse model (Pákáski and Kálmán, 2008).

Here, we report that gintonin stimulates acetylcholine release in cells expressing endogenous LPA receptor. In addition, oral administration of gintonin restored scopolamine-induced memory dysfunctions, blocked Aβ-induced reductions of acetylcholine concentration and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity, and also reduced acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the mouse hippocampus. Furthermore, in a transgenic AD mouse model, long-term treatment of gintonin blocked amyloid plaque-induced reductions of acetylcholine concentration and ChAT activity and reduced AChE activity in the mouse hippocampus. We discuss how gintonin-mediated LPA receptor activation is coupled to the reinforcement of the cholinergic system that was damaged by a cholinergic blocker, by Aβ-infusion into the brain, and in the transgenic AD mouse model. We propose that gintonin could be utilized as an agent for restoration of the cholinergic system damaged by Aβ.
Gintonin was prepared from Panax ginseng according to a previous method (Pyo et al. 2011). Because of gintonin’s scarcity in animal experiments, we used a gintonin-enriched fraction. The gintonin-enriched fraction was prepared as follows. One kilogram of 4-year-old ginseng was ground into small pieces (> 3 mm) and refluxed with 70% fermented ethanol eight times for 8 h at 80°C each. The extracts (150 g) were concentrated, dissolved in distilled, cold water at a ratio of 1 to 10, and stored at 4°C for 24–96 h. The supernatant and precipitate of water fractionation after ethanol extraction of ginseng were separated by centrifugation (3000 rpm, 20 min). The precipitate after centrifugation was lyophilized. This fraction was designated the gintonin-enriched fraction, since this fraction contains most of the gintonin (Choi et al., 2015a). For in vitro study, gintonin was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and then diluted with bath medium before use. The final DMSO concentration was less than 0.01%. For in vivo studies, the gintonin-enriched fraction was dissolved in saline. The Amplex® Red Acetylcholine/Acetylcholinesterase Assay Kit (A-12217) was purchased from Invitrogen (USA). The primary antibody against choline acetyltransferase was purchased from Millipore (Bedford, MA, USA). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA).
Male ICR or C57BL/6 mice (4- or 8-weeks-old) were purchased from Koatech Co., Ltd. (Pyongtaek, Korea). Breeding pairs of double Tg mice expressing the mutant swe-AβPP (AβPPswe) gene and the mutant presenilin-1 (PSEN-1) gene (deletion of exon 9) [AβPPswe/PSEN-1 double Tg mice; B6C3-Tg (AβPPswe/PSEN1dE9) 85Dbo/J, The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA] were bred and housed in an approved animal facility at Kangwon National University (Korea). Six-month-old AβPPswe/PSEN1dE9 double Tg mice were treated with gintonin (25 or 50 mg/kg, p.o. administration) or donepezil (DPZ) (1 mg/kg, i.p. injection) thrice a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) for 3 months. The immunohistochemistry for choline acetyltransferase commenced when the mice were 9-months-old. The animals were housed five per cage, allowed access to water and food ad libitum, and maintained under a constant temperature (23 ± 1°C) and humidity (55 ± 5%) under a 12 h light/dark cycle (lights on 07:00 to 19:00 h). All experiments were conducted in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the Kangwon (Permit Number: 13–156) and Konkuk (Permit Number: 14–956) Universities. All surgeries were performed under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering.
β-Amyloid (Aβ)40-1 and Aβ1–40 (American Peptide Co., USA) were dissolved in 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4), and aliquots were stored at −20°C. Each aliquot was aggregated by incubation in sterile distilled water at 37°C for 4 days. Two month-old C57BL/6 mice were administered Aβ40-1 or Aβ1–40 [400 pmol, i.c.v. injection] according to the procedure established by Hwang et al. (2012b). Each mouse was injected consciously at the bregma with a 10-μl microsyringe (Hamilton, USA) fitted with a 26-gauge needle that was inserted to a depth of 2.4 mm. The injection volume was 5 μl. The injection placement or needle track was visible and was verified at the time of dissection.
Hippocampal neural progenitor cultures were prepared according to the method described by Kim et al. (2011). Briefly, on embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5), embryos were dissected from adult, female, pregnant C57BL/6 mice. The hippocampal regions of embryonic brains were isolated in calcium/magnesium-free Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS). The cells were plated at 2.5 × 104 cells/cm2 on 10-cm-diameter dishes coated with 15 μg/ml poly-l-ornithine and 1 μg/ml fibronectin (Invitrogen). The cells were placed in N2 media supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen) at 37°C in a 95% air/5% CO2 gas incubator. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, 20 ng/ml, R&D Systems) and epidermal growth factor (EGF, 20 ng/ml, R&D Systems) were required daily in order to expand the population of neural precursors, and the medium was changed every other day. Cells at 80% confluency were passaged and maintained at 6 × 104 cells/cm2 in B27-supplemented N2 media containing bFGF and EGF. These sub-cultured progenitors were induced to differentiate by withdrawing bFGF and EGF and kept in differentiation media (Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27) for 3 to 5 days.
Mice were sacrificed one day after the behavioral study. The hippocampal tissues were homogenated in ice-cold 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), and tissue homogenates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatant was assayed for ACh levels using an Amplex® Red Acetylcholine/Acetylcholinesterase Assay Kit (A-12217; Invitrogen, USA). According to the manufacturer’s instructions, reactions were initiated by adding 100 μl of the working solution, containing 400 μM Amplex Red reagent, 2 U/ml horseradish peroxidase (HRP), 0.2 U/ml choline oxidase, and 1 U/ml acetylcholinesterase, to each microplate well containing 100 μl of the standard or test sample. Each reaction was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with plate agitation and protection from light. Absorbance was then measured using a microplate reader (Molecular Devices, USA) at a wavelength of 563 nm. Hippocampal acetylcholine levels were calculated from a standard curve and expressed as nmol/mg protein (Jin et al., 2009). Protein concentrations were determined using a Quant-iT™ Protein assay kit (Invitrogen).
AChE activity was also measured using an Amplex® Red Acetylcholine/Acetylcholinesterase Assay Kit (A-12217; Invitrogen). A working solution, containing 400 μM Amplex Red reagent, 2 U/ml HRP, 0.2 U/ml choline oxidase, and 100 μM acetylcholine, was used for AChE activity measurement. For ChAT activity, 5% tissue homogenates were prepared in ice-cold 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and kept frozen overnight at −20°C. They were thawed on the following day and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. The supernatant was assayed for ChAT activity according to the method of Chao and Wolfgram (Chao and Wolfgram, 1972). Each reaction mixture (0.4 ml), containing 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), 0.31 mM acetyl-CoA, 50 mM choline chloride, 38 μM neostigmine sulfate, 0.15 M NaCl, and 55 μM EDTA, was preincubated in centrifuge tubes in a water bath at 37°C for 5 min. One-hundred microliters of the homogenate was then added to the reaction mixture, and the tubes were kept at 37°C for an additional 20 min. The reaction was stopped by boiling for 2 min, and 1 ml of oxygen-free distilled water was added to the tubes. The denatured protein was removed by centrifugation. One milliliter of supernatant was added to a tube containing 30 μl of 1 mM 4,4′-dithiopyridine. After a 15-min incubation, the absorbance was measured at 324 nm with a spectrophotometer. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as 1 μmol of reduced coenzyme formed/min·mg protein. Protein was assayed as mentioned above.
Mice were first perfused transcardially with a 50-mL syringe containing ice-cold PBS (10 ml/10 g body weight) and then followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (20 ml/10 g body weight) for immunocytochemical analysis (Hooijmans et al., 2007; Jung et al., 2010). The brains were collected and stored in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight. To quench endogenous peroxidase activity, sections were pre-incubated with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in PBS for 30 min and then incubated in PBS containing 0.4% Triton X-100 for 20 min and 1% normal serum for 20 min. Sections were incubated for 48 h with the primary antibody against AChE (1:100, Millipore, Millipore, USA) or ChAT (1:100, Millipore, Millipore, USA), and were further incubated with the secondary biotinylated antisera (1:1000, Vector Laboratories, USA) for 1 h. Then, sections were immersed in a solution containing an avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (Vector Laboratories) for 1 h, and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine was used as the chromogen. Digital images were acquired on an Olympus microscope (BX51, Olympus®, Tokyo, Japan) using an attached digital microscope camera (DP72, Olympus®) and IBM PC. Region of interest (ROI) was created by Optimas® version 6.51 (Media Cybernetics, Inc. USA). Subsequent quantification was performed using ImageJ version 1.47 software (National Institutes of Health, USA) as described previously (Wang et al., 2012). Briefly, background was subtracted using the rolling ball “Subtract Background” command to correct uneven background. ChAT-immunopositive neurites were selected by adjusting threshold values for hue (0–255), saturation (0–255), and brightness (0–240) in the “Adjust Color Threshold” dialog box, and then the integrated density was measured. The results are expressed as the percentage of control mice.
The passive avoidance test was performed as previously described using a Gemini Avoidance System (San Diego Instruments, USA) (Kim et al., 2013). Briefly, during the acquisition trial, each mouse was first placed into a dark compartment as the start chamber. After 20 s, this chamber was illuminated, and the door was opened to allow the mouse to freely move into the second dark chamber. After the mouse had entered the dark chamber, the door was immediately closed. One unavoidable and scrambled electric shock (0.8 mA, 2 s) was given through the floor grid. The mouse was then returned to its home cage. Each mouse was placed in the start chamber again 24 h later. The interval between the placement in the illuminated chamber and entry into the dark chamber was measured as the step-through latency in both the acquisition and the retention trials up to 300 s. Mice were daily treated with gintonin-enriched fraction (control vehicle, 25, 50, or 100 mg/kg) for three weeks by oral administration. Acquisition trial was performed one hour after the last treatment with gintonin-enriched fraction. Thirty minutes before the acquisition trial (i.e., 30 min after the last treatment with gintonin-enriched fraction), memory impairment was induced by administering scopolamine (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.). The control group has been received saline rather than gintonin-enriched fraction.
A rounded pool (97 cm in diameter and 60 cm in height) was used for Morris water maze test according to the previous procedure with slight modifications (Kim et al., 2013). Briefly, the circular pool was filled to a depth height of 30 cm with clouded water (20 ± 1°C) with powdered milk. The top of the platform (6 cm in diameter and 29 cm in height) was 1 cm below the water surface in the center of one quadrant of the maze. The first day of the experiment was performed for swimming training for 60 s in the absence of the platform. From the next day, the mice were received trial sessions for four days. In each daily training session, the mice were subjected to four successive training trials. During each trial, the escape latency of each mouse was measured using a stopwatch. This parameter was averaged for each session of trials and for each mouse. Once the mouse located the platform, the mouse was allowed to stay on it for 10 s. If the mouse did not locate the platform within 60 s, the mouse was placed on the platform for 10 s. The time interval between each trial was 30 s. On the last day of training, mice were given a probe trial session, in which the platform from the pool was removed and mice were allowed to swim in search of it for 60 s. The swimming time was recorded in the pool quadrant, where the platform had previously been placed was maintained. Mice were also daily treated with gintonin-enriched fraction (control vehicle, 25, 50, or 100 mg/kg) for three weeks by oral administration including the last four days of the training sessions. During the training sessions, gintonin-enriched fraction was administered one hour before each training session. Thirty minutes later, mice were treated with scopolamine (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) to induce memory impairment.
Statistical comparisons between controls and treated experimental groups were made using Student’s t-test unless otherwise stated. Statistical analyses were performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or repeated measures one-way ANOVA. A post-hoc Fisher’s protected least significant difference (PLSD) test followed. Data are expressed as the mean ± SEM. A P value < 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant.
In previous reports, we showed that gintonin derived from ginseng is a novel ligand for LPA receptors (Hwang et al., 2012a). Since LPA receptors are well expressed during the developmental stages of the brain (Hecht et al., 1996) and LPA promotes differentiation of rat embryonic neural stem cells to cholinergic neurons (Cui and Qiao, 2006), we examined the effects of gintonin on the coupling of [Ca2+]i transients to acetylcholine release using cultured hippocampal NPCs, which mainly express the LPA1 receptor (Sun et al., 2010). We first examined the effects of gintonin on [Ca2+]i transients in hippocampal NPCs. As shown in Figs. 1A and 1B, gintonin treatment induced a transient rise of [Ca2+]i in NPCs in a reversible and concentration-dependent manner. The EC50 was 0.21 ± 0.03 μg/ml. Gintonin-induced [Ca2+]i transients were initiated without a detectable lag and reached peak values within a few seconds, and [Ca2+]i gradually decreased and returned to basal level. We observed that treatment of NPC12 cells with LPA C18:1 also induced a [Ca2+]i transient, similar to gintonin (data not shown). We examined the effects of gintonin on [Ca2+]i transients in the absence or presence of the LPA1/3 receptor antagonist Ki16425. As shown in Figs. 1C and 1E, the presence of Ki16425 significantly attenuated the gintonin-mediated [Ca2+]i transient. The active phospholipase C inhibitor U73122, the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor antagonist 2-APB, and the intracellular Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM all blocked gintonin-mediated [Ca2+]i transients in NPCs (Figs. 1D and 1E). These results show that gintonin, via activation of the LPA receptor-phospholipase C-intracellular IP3 receptor signaling transduction pathway, elicits the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores to increase [Ca2+]i.
Since the induction of depolarization by elevation of extracellular K+ or receptor ligands that induce a [Ca2+]i transient is coupled to neurotransmitter release, we next examined the effects of gintonin on acetylcholine release in hippocampal NPCs. As shown in Fig. 1F, gintonin stimulated acetylcholine release in a concentration-dependent manner. The maximal gintonin-induced acetylcholine release increase was 2-fold with a concentration of 3 μg/ml; higher concentrations of gintonin had no additional effect (Fig. 1F). LPA1/3 receptor antagonist Ki16425 blocked gintonin-induced acetylcholine release. Treatment with an intracellular calcium chelator, BAPTA-AM, abolished the gintonin action, indicating that the gintonin effect on acetylcholine release is LPA receptor- and calcium-dependent (Fig. 1F). The representative ginsenoside such as ginsenoside Rb1 had no effect, but ginsenoside Rg1 inhibited acetylcholine release (Fig. 1F). These results indicate that gintonin, but not ginsenosides, stimulates acetylcholine release through LPA receptor activation and its signal transduction pathway.
Since ChAT is a key enzyme for acetylcholine synthesis, we further examined whether gintonin treatment to hippocampal NPCs affects on the expression level of ChAT. We found that gintonin increased ChAT expression through immunostaining and immunoblotting (Supplementary Figs. S1A and S1B). To explore if oral administration of gintonin could also increase ChAT expression in the brain, we examined the effect of gintonin on in vivo ChAT immunoreactivity in wild-type adult mouse hippocampal neurons. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 2, saline administration did not show much ChAT immunoreactivity in hippocampal regions but oral administration of gintonin for 3 weeks significantly increased ChAT immunoreactivity of the hippocampal regions. Interestingly, in ChAT immunoreactivity of the hippocampal regions, gintonin treatment (50 and 100 mg/kg) showed stronger ChAT immunoreactivity at the CA1 and dentate gyrus (DG) compared to the CA3 area (Supplementary Fig. S2). These results indicate that gintonin might have cholinergic stimulating or upregulating effects mediated by the increase of expression of ChAT in neurons during the developmental stage of the hippocampus as well as in the adult mouse hippocampus.
Next, we examined whether oral administration of gintonin-enriched fraction could ameliorate scopolamine-induced memory dysfunction. As shown in Fig. 2A, the effect of gintonin on memory function was first examined in a passive avoidance test. Treatment with scopolamine alone decreased the step-through latency time (Fig. 2A, *P < 0.01, compared with control vehicle), whereas the gintonin-enriched fraction treatment groups (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg, p.o.) demonstrated significantly improved latency times in a dose-dependent manner compared with the control group (Fig. 2A, #P < 0.05, compared with control). In addition, we also measured the effects of gintonin-enriched fraction using the Morris water maze task (Figs. 2B and 2C). The scopolamine-treated group exhibited longer escape latencies throughout the training days than the control vehicle group (*P < 0.01). The gintonin-enriched fraction significantly shortened the escape latencies prolonged by treatment with scopolamine on the last day of the training trial sessions in a dose-dependent manner (#P < 0.05, compared with scopolamine treatment group) (Fig. 2B). On the day following the final day of the training trial sessions, swimming times within the platform quadrant for the scopolamine-treated group were significantly lower than those of the control vehicle group (*P < 0.01). However, treatment with gintonin-enriched fraction significantly increased the swimming time shortened by scopolamine (#P < 0.05) (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that oral administration of gintonin-enriched fraction ameliorates scopolamine-induced memory dysfunctions.
Aβ-induced cholinergic dysfunctions are considered the main causes of memory impairments in patients with AD or in AD animal models (Bales et al., 2006; Maurice et al., 1996). In our previous study, we showed that oral administration of gintonin ameliorated Aβ (1–40)-induced memory impairment (Hwang et al., 2012a). However, it remains unknown whether the ameliorating effects of gintonin against memory impairment caused by Aβ (1–40) are achieved via improvement of the cholinergic system. In this study, since we showed that gintonin stimulates acetylcholine release and attenuates scopolamine-induced memory impairment (Figs. 1 and ​and2),2), we further investigated whether gintonin also protects against Aβ-induced cholinergic system disturbances including acetylcholine concentration and AChE or ChAT activity. We first examined the effects of gintonin on Aβ-induced cholinergic system dysfunction according to the procedure described in Fig. 3A. We observed that the hippo-campal acetylcholine levels significantly decreased in the Aβ (1–40)-infused mice [*P < 0.01 vs. Sal + Aβ (40-1)] (Fig. 3B), and treatment with gintonin significantly attenuated this effect [25 or 50 mg/kg gintonin + Aβ (1–40) vs. Sal + Aβ (1–40), #P < 0.05 or ##P < 0.01] (Fig. 3B). In addition, Aβ (1–40) significantly increased AChE activity [*P < 0.01 vs. Sal + Aβ (40-1)], but significantly decreased ChAT activity [*P < 0.01 vs. Sal + Aβ (40-1)] in the mouse hippocampus; these results are consistent with previous reports of Aβ-induced cholinergic dysfunction (Bales et al., 2006; Maurice et al., 1996). However, oral administration of gintonin 3 days before Aβ (1–40) infusion significantly attenuated the changes in AChE and ChAT activities [both AChE and ChAT activity: 25 or 50 mg/kg gintonin + Aβ (1–40) vs. Sal + Aβ (1–40), #P < 0.05 or ##P < 0.01] (Fig. 3C). The effect of gintonin on Aβ (1–40)-induced cholinergic dysfunction was comparable to that of donepezil (1 mg/kg) (Figs. 3B and 3C). These results indicate that gintonin significantly protects the cholinergic system from Aβ-induced cholinergic dysfunction in the mouse hippocampus.
Since it was reported that central injection of Aβ (1–40) could induce direct axonal toxicity of septohippocampal cholinergic neurons (Colom et al., 2011), the effects of Aβ on ChAT-immunoreactivity (ChAT-IR) in the mouse hippocampus were examined next. Our results were in line with previous study, showing that injection of Aβ (1–40) resulted in a significant decrease in ChAT-IR in the hippocampus [CA1: *P < 0.05 vs. Saline + Aβ (40-1); CA3: **P < 0.01 vs. Saline + Aβ (40-1)] (Fig. 4, upper panel). Oral administration of gintonin significantly attenuated the Aβ (1–40)-induced decrease in ChAT-IR [CA1: 25 or 50 mg/kg gintonin + Aβ (1–40) vs. Saline + Aβ (1–40), #P < 0.05 or ##P < 0.01; CA3: 25 or 50 mg/kg gintonin + Aβ (1–40) vs. Saline + Aβ (1–40), ##P < 0.01; dentate gyrus (DG): 50 mg/kg gintonin + Aβ (1–40) vs. Saline + Aβ (1–40), #P < 0.05] (Fig. 4, lower panel), and these effects were comparable to those of donepezil (1 mg/kg) (Fig. 4). These results are consistent with the results of above-mentioned biochemical analyses on gintonin-mediated protection of cholinergic systems against Aβ.
TAccumulating evidences showed that dystrophy and reorganization of cholinergic terminals are observed in the hippocampus and cortex of APPswe/PSEN-1 double Tg mice without significant change in cholinergic neuronal bodies of basal fore-brain system, including medial septum and nucleus basalis (Jaffar et al., 2001; Perez et al., 2007; Wong et al., 1999). In these studies, cholinergic axonal dystrophy in the hippocampus could be observed as early as 2–3 months of age, that is prior to the formation of amyloid deposition, while there was no significant change in cholinergic neuronal bodies in the medial septum and nucleus basalis of 10–16-month-old APPswe/PSEN-1 double Tg mice with extensive amyloid deposition. Thus, we have focused on the changes in ChAT-IR in the hippocampus. Hippocampal ChAT-IR was significantly lower in the APPswe/PSEN-1 double Tg mice than that in the non-Tg mice (CA1 and CA3: **P < 0.01 vs. non-Tg mice treated with saline; DG: *P < 0.05 vs. non-Tg mice treated with saline) (Fig. 6, upper panel). Long-term treatment with gintonin (25 or 50 mg/kg, p.o., thrice a week for 3 months) significantly increased hippocampal ChAT-IR [CA1 and CA3: 25 or 50 mg/kg gintonin vs. Saline, ##P < 0.01; DG: 50 mg/kg gintonin vs. Saline, #P < 0.05] in the APPswe/PSEN-1 double Tg mice, and these effects were comparable to those of donepezil (1 mg/kg) (Fig. 6, lower panel). These results are consistent with the results above-mentioned biochemical analyses on gintonin-mediated protection of cholinergic systems in the APPswe/PSEN-1 double Tg mice.
The long-term effects of gintonin on the level of acetylcholine and activities of AChE and ChAT in the APPswe/PSEN-1 double Tg mice were examined according to the procedure described in Fig. 5A. Chronic treatment with gintonin (25 or 50 mg/kg, p.o., thrice a week for 3 months) significantly increased acetylcholine levels (25 or 50 mg/kg gintonin vs. Sal, #P < 0.05 or ##P < 0.01) (Fig. 5B) and ChAT activity (25 or 50 mg/kg gintonin vs. Sal, #P < 0.05 or ##P < 0.01), but significantly decreased AChE activity in the hippocampus of the APPswe/PSEN-1 double Tg mice (25 or 50 mg/kg gintonin vs. Sal, #P < 0.05 or ##P < 0.01) (Fig. 5C), indicating that gintonin improves the hippocampal cholinergic function in the AD model mice. The effect of gintonin on the hippocampal cholinergic function of APPswe/PSEN-1 double Tg mice was comparable to that of donepezil (1 mg/kg, thrice a week for 3 months), and these results are in accordance with those observed in the acute Aβ (1–40)-treated mice (Fig. 5).
Accumulating evidences showed that dystrophy and reorganization of cholinergic terminals are observed in the hippocampus and cortex of APPswe/PSEN-1 double Tg mice without significant change in cholinergic neuronal bodies of basal fore-brain system, including medial septum and nucleus basalis (Jaffar et al., 2001; Perez et al., 2007; Wong et al., 1999). In these studies, cholinergic axonal dystrophy in the hippocampus could be observed as early as 2–3 months of age, that is prior to the formation of amyloid deposition, while there was no significant change in cholinergic neuronal bodies in the medial septum and nucleus basalis of 10–16-month-old APPswe/PSEN-1 double Tg mice with extensive amyloid deposition. Thus, we have focused on the changes in ChAT-IR in the hippocampus. Hippocampal ChAT-IR was significantly lower in the APPswe/PSEN-1 double Tg mice than that in the non-Tg mice (CA1 and CA3: **P < 0.01 vs. non-Tg mice treated with saline; DG: *P < 0.05 vs. non-Tg mice treated with saline) (Fig. 6, upper panel). Long-term treatment with gintonin (25 or 50 mg/kg, p.o., thrice a week for 3 months) significantly increased hippocampal ChAT-IR [CA1 and CA3: 25 or 50 mg/kg gintonin vs. Saline, ##P < 0.01; DG: 50 mg/kg gintonin vs. Saline, #P < 0.05] in the APPswe/PSEN-1 double Tg mice, and these effects were comparable to those of donepezil (1 mg/kg) (Fig. 6, lower panel). These results are consistent with the results above-mentioned biochemical analyses on gintonin-mediated protection of cholinergic systems in the APPswe/PSEN-1 double Tg mice.
Human AD is a progressive neurodegenerative disease associated with age (Alzheimer, 1907). As the most common form of dementia, the number of AD patients is increasing almost exponentially with the aged population (Yankner, 1996). Two important characteristics of AD are the formation of senile plaques containing Aβ and dysfunctions of the cholinergic system in the brain (Vassar et al., 1999). Accumulating evidence shows that Aβ causes imbalances of the cholinergic system by increasing AChE and decreasing ChAT activity and by subsequently showing selective toxicity to cholinergic neurons (Bales et al., 2006; Bartus et al., 1982; Maurice et al., 1996). Therefore, AChE inhibitors, agents or drugs acting on the cholinergic system, or muscarinic agonists, which target the m1 muscarinic receptor, are being investigated for AD prevention and therapeutics (Davie et al., 2013). However, little is known about whether activation of the G protein-coupled LPA receptor could also modulate the cholinergic system and further ameliorate scopolamine-induced or acute or long-term Aβ-induced dysfunctions of the cholinergic system.

In this study, we examined whether gintonin affects in vitro and in vivo cholinergic functions in mouse hippocampal NPCs, scopolamine-treated mice, Aβ-infused mice, and a transgenic AD mouse model. We could obtain three major findings that gintonin-mediated activation of LPA receptors could be associated with the cholinergic system regulations. First, gintonin-mediated [Ca2+]i transient is coupled to acetylcholine release in cultured hippocampal NPCs (Fig. 1) and also increased the expression of ChAT in hippocampal NPCs as well as in the wild-type mouse hippocampus (Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2). Second, gintonin-enriched fraction significantly attenuates scopolamine-induced cognitive dysfunctions (Fig. 2). Third, gintonin has a protective effect on the cholinergic system against the dysfunction induced by Aβ-infusion and in the transgenic AD mouse model (Figs. 3​3​–6). Thus, short-term oral administration of gintonin attenuated Aβ-induced dysfunctions of the hippocampal cholinergic system by inhibiting AChE and by increasing ChAT and acetylcholine concentrations (Figs. 3 and ​and4).4). Long-term oral administration of gintonin also attenuated hippocampal cholinergic dysfunctions in the AD mouse model (Figs. 5 and ​and6).6). These results indicate that activation of G protein-coupled LPA receptors by gintonin could induce beneficial effects on the cholinergic system in hippocampus under infusion of Aβ and in the transgenic AD mouse model.

There could be a question what are the molecular mechanisms underlying the gintonin-mediated protective effects on the cholinergic system against scopolamine-induced memory impairments and Aβ-infused cholinergic dysfunction in wild-type mice and in the long-term transgenic AD mouse model. Gintonin could act in three ways in this study. Firstly, previous reports showed that acute treatment of cortical neuroblast cells with LPA induces an increased conductance that consists of non-selective cation currents (Dubin et al., 1999) and that LPA also induces dopamine and glutamate release in PC12 cells and hippocampal glutamatergic neurons, respectively (Shiono et al., 1993; Trimbuch et al., 2009). Thus, gintonin might also act as a neurotransmitter, and acute gintonin treatment could increase neurotransmitter release and enhance synaptic transmission in the hippocampus via N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation (Hwang et al., 2015; Park et al., 2015; Shin et al., 2012). In present study, we further demonstrated that gintonin stimulates acetylcholine release in an intracellular Ca2+-sensitive manner through the LPA receptor in NPCs and also increased brain acetylcholine concentration under Aβ infusion and in transgenic AD mouse models. Thus, the additional gintonin-mediated regulations of cholinergic system might contribute to restorations from cholinergic dysfunctions by scopolamine-induced memory impairments and Aβ-infused cholinergic dysfunction in wild-type mice.

Secondly, LPA is a phospholipid growth factor and affects diverse cell functions via LPA receptors (Tabuchi et al., 2000). Gintonin, as an exogenous LPA receptor ligand, could exert its effect to increase of ChAT expression and the gintonin-induced ChAT expression might be coupled to the increase of acetylcholine synthesis and might help to ameliorate hippocampal cholinergic dysfunctions under Aβ infusion and in transgenic AD mouse models. In addition, it is known that sAPPα exhibits the neuroprotective and neurotrophic effects (Hasebe et al., 2013). In previous report we demonstrated that gintonin stimulates sAPPα release, while gintonin inhibits Aβ formation via non-amyloidogenic pathway (Hwang et al., 2012b). Activation of m1 muscarinic receptor by acetylcholine is also coupled to sAPPα release (Kim et al., 2006). Acetylcholine that is released by gintonin via LPA receptor activation might also indirectly contribute to sAPPα release rather than Aβ formation (Fig. 1F). Thus, direct gintonin-mediated increase of ChAT expression and sAPPα release and indirect sAPPα release via m1 muscarinic receptor by acetylcholine might be together coupled to protection of the cholinergic system induced by Aβ insult and in the transgenic AD mouse model.

The last possibility is that gintonin-mediated LPA receptor activation is coupled to dual signaling pathways. Gintonin-mediated activations of LPA receptor could induce acetylcholine release and increase acetylcholine synthesis as role of a lipid-derived neurotransmitter and/or tropic factor. Gintonin-mediated activations of LPA receptor could be also coupled to the stimulation of neurotrophic and neuroprotective sAPPα release in the hippocampus. Therefore, both gintonin-mediated maintenance of acetylcholine levels by restoring cholinergic systems under Aβ or scopolamine insult and gintonin-mediated beneficial sAPPα formation in nervous system might contribute to conserve cholinergic systems against Aβ and in the transgenic AD mouse model. Figure 7 shows a schematic diagram of how gintonin-mediated LPA receptor activations are coupled to anti-AD actions via stimulations of cholinergic systems and sAPPα formation
Gintonin is a unique form of herbal-medicine LPA, as it consists of LPAs-ginseng protein complexes. Recent study showed how GLP151 protein as a protein component of gintonin binds to LPA through the elucidation of three-dimensional structure of GLP151. The phosphate group of LPA binds to the imidazole ring of histidine residues at C-terminal of GLP151 with hydrogen bonds and acyl-chain of LPA interacts with other amino acids though hydrophobic interactions of GLP151 (Choi et al., 2015b). GLP151 protein was identified as a first plant-derived carrier or transporter of LPA, and deliver LPA to cognitive LPA receptors (Choi et al., 2015b). Ginsenoside is also another component of ginseng with various effects in biological system. However, the representative ginsenosides such as Rb1 or Rg1 had no effects on [Ca2+]i transients in hippocampal NPCs (data not shown) and ginsenoside Rg1 did not induce acetylcholine release and ginsenoside Rb1 rather inhibited acetylcholine release in hippocampal NPCs (Fig. 1F). Thus, we provide additional information that gintonin but not ginsenosides is the main active ingredient of ginseng for acetylcholine release in hippocampal NPCs.

In conclusion, we showed that gintonin increases acetylcholine release and ChAT expression in hippocampal NPCs through LPA receptors. We also showed that gintonin attenuates scopolamine-induced memory impairment and Aβ-induced cholinergic impairments in wild type and transgenic AD mouse models. Finally, we suggest that, in addition to gintonin-mediated non-amyloidogenic pathway activation, the anti-AD effect of gintonin might be achieved via its boosting effects on the cholinergic system. These actions of gintonin might be an additional molecular basis for the neuroprotective effects of ginseng on AD-related neuropathies.

Persistent ocular surface pain occurs in moderate to severe dry eye disease (DE); however, the mechanisms that underlie this symptom remain uncertain. The aim of this study was to determine if the transient receptor potential vanilloid ion channels play a role in hypertonic saline (HS)-evoked corneal reflexes in a model for aqueous tear deficient DE.
Eye wipe behavior and orbicularis oculi muscle activity (OOemg) were measured after ocular instillation of HS, capsaicin, or menthol 14 days after exorbital gland removal. Total RNA and protein were measured from anterior eye segment and trigeminal ganglia of sham and DE rats.
Eye wipe behavior was enhanced in DE rats after HS and capsaicin instillation, but not after menthol when compared to sham rats. DE rats displayed greater OOemg activity after HS and capsaicin, but not after menthol, compared to sham rats. HS-evoked OOemg activity was reduced by selective TRPV1 antagonists and by coapplication of capsaicin plus QX-314, a charged lidocaine derivative. Menthol did not affect OOemg activity; however, selective antagonism of TRPM8 reduced HS-evoked OOemg activity. TRPV1 protein levels were increased in anterior eye segment and trigeminal ganglion samples from DE rats, whereas TRPM8 levels were not affected.
These results suggest that TRPV1 plays a significant role in mediating enhanced nocifensive behavior in DE, while TRPM8 may play a lesser role. Strategies to target specific transducer molecules on corneal nerves may prove beneficial as adjunct therapies in managing ocular pain in moderate to severe cases of DE.

Patients with moderate to severe dry eye disease (DE) often report persistent ocular surface pain (POSP).1–3 Conservative therapies are sufficient to manage symptoms in mild DE4,5; however, management in more severe cases has proved difficult.6–8 An alternative approach would be to directly target receptor molecules on corneal nociceptors. The properties and expression of transducer receptor channels on corneal nociceptors are well described9,10; however, the effects of chronic inflammation on corneal polymodal and mechano-nociceptors are less certain. Although factors known to excite corneal nociceptors are elevated in tears of DE patients,11–13 the relationship between nociceptor activity and ocular pain is limited due to a lack of reliable measures of adverse behavior in animals. The present study uses a model for tear deficient DE14–16 and recording of muscle activity via orbicularis oculi muscle electromyography (OOemg),17 to assess the roles of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) and melastatin 8 (TRPM8) ion channels on hypertonic saline (HS)–evoked ocular behavior. HS is well correlated with disease severity and is a risk factor for ocular irritation in DE.18 The present study sought to determine if a pattern of evoked OOemg activity existed in anesthetized animals that was consistent with eye wiping in conscious animals, a recognized adverse behavior.19–21 The results indicate that TRPV1 is critical for HS-evoked OOemg activity at osmotic concentrations of HS necessary to cause pain sensation in humans,22 while TRPM8 plays only a minor role.
A total of 141 male rats (250–350 g, Sprague-Dawley, Harlan, Indianapolis, IN, USA) were used. Data from four rats were excluded from final OOemg analyses due to persistent low arterial pressure after anesthesia. Animals were housed in pairs and given free access to food and water in a climate- and light-controlled environment (25°C ± 2°C, 12:12-hour light/dark cycle with light on at 7:00 AM). The animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Minnesota (Minneapolis, MN, USA) according to the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research and The National Institutes of Health guide for the Care and the Use of Laboratory Animals (PHS Law 99-158, revised 2015). All efforts were made to minimize the number of the animals used.
The following chemicals were applied to the ocular surface: TRPV1 receptor agonist, capsaicin (in 10% ethanol, 10% Tween 80, diluted in normal saline); TRPV1 antagonist, 2E-N-(2,3-dihydro-1,4-benzodioxin-6-yl)-3-[4-1,1-imethylethyl-phenyl]-2-2-propenamide (AMG 9810, in 1% DMSO, diluted in saline); TRPV1 antagonist, capsazepine (in 1% DMSO diluted in saline); charged membrane impermeant lidocaine derivative, N-(2,6 dimethylphenylcarbamoylmethyl) triethylammonium bromide (QX-314, diluted in saline); TRPM8 agonist, L-menthol (in 10% ethanol diluted in saline); and TRPM8 antagonist, N-(3-aminopropyl)-2-[3-methylphenyl-methoxyl]-N-2-thienylmethyl benzamide hydrochloride (AMTB, diluted in saline). Drugs were purchased from Bio-Techne (Minneapolis, MN, USA) or from Sigma-Aldrich Corp. (St. Louis, MO, USA).
Rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (3%–5%) and the skin anterior to the ear was shaved. A small skin incision was made over the masseter muscle to expose and remove the left exorbital gland. The wound margins were treated with 2% xylocaine gel and the incision was closed with absorbable suture. The gland was exposed in sham rats but was not removed. Ketoprofen (25 mg/kg, intraperitoneally [IP]) was given as a single dose after surgery. Rats survived for 14 days after surgery before testing.
Rats were habituated to a plexiglass testing chamber for 1 hour and eye wipe behavior (i.e., purposeful forelimb swipes toward the eye, was measured over 5 minutes). Eye wipes were evoked by ocular instillation of HS (0.15, 1.0, 2.5 M NaCl, pH 7.2), capsaicin (vehicle, 0.327, 3.27, 32.7 μM), or menthol (vehicle, 20, 100, 200 μM) 1 to 2 days prior to OOemg recording. In a separate series, sham and DE rats received vehicle, QX-314 (2%) alone, 2.5 M NaCl or coapplication of QX-314 plus 2.5M NaCl. Agents were applied to the left eye from a micropipette (20 μL) and eye wipes were counted without prior knowledge of surgical or drug treatment.
Rats were anesthetized with urethane (1.2-1.5 g/kg, IP) and spontaneous tear volume was measured by the increase in wet length of phenol red thread (ZONE-QUICK; Menicon, Inc., San Mateo, CA, USA) at 14 days after surgery. The thread was gently placed in contact with the cornea/conjunctiva at its inferior-lateral edge and tear volume was measured over 2 minutes.
Mean arterial blood pressure was monitored from a cannula in the left femoral artery and maintained at 90 to 110 mm Hg. Wound margins were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine and body temperature was kept at 38°C with a heating blanket. Rats were allowed to breathe spontaneously. The rat was placed in a stereotaxic frame and Teflon-coated copper wires (0.12 mm diameter) were implanted by a 26-gauge needle near the center of the upper and lower OO muscles, proximal to the lid margins, and grounded by a wire inserted in the neck muscle.23 In separate animals (n = 3), pairs of wire electrodes were placed in the upper and lower portions of the OO muscle to determine the relative amplitude and timing of OOemg activity from a HS stimulus (see Fig. 3A).
At least 1 hour elapsed after placement of the OOemg electrodes before the recording session began. Two experimental designs were used (design one, Fig. 1A). Dose-effect responses were determined for ocular application of: HS (0.15, 1.0, 2.5 M), capsaicin (vehicle, 0.327, 3.27, 32.7 μM) or menthol (vehicle, 20, 100, 200 μM). Test solutions remained on the eye for 3 to 4 minutes and then washed out with artificial tears. Each stimulus period was separated by 30 minutes (design two, Fig. 1B). HS (2.5 M) was applied before and 30 minutes after ocular instillation of the following drugs: selective TRPV1 receptor antagonist (AMG9810, 10 μM), nonselective TRPV1 antagonist (capsazepine, 100 μM), selective nociceptor silencing by coapplication of capsaicin (0.327 or 3.27 μM) plus QX-314 (2%), and selective TRPM8 receptor antagonist (AMTB [10, 20, or 50 μM]). Drugs were prepared fresh each day and applied in a total volume of 20 μL. The doses of AMG 9810, capsazepine, and AMTB were similar to those reported to be effective in previous studies.24
OOemg activity was sampled at 1000 Hz, amplified (×10k), filtered (bandwidth 10–300 Hz), displayed and stored offline for later analysis (ADInstruments, Colorado Spring, CO, USA). OOemg activity was recorded continuously for 6 minutes from 3 minutes before (baseline activity) until 3 minutes after stimulus onset, rectified and stored as 1-second bins for off-line analyses. OOemg activity was calculated initially from the raw signal as total activity defined as the integrated area under the curve (AUC) for the 3-minute epoch (μV-s/3 minutes) sampled after the stimulus minus the 3-minute epoch recorded prior to each HS stimulus (i.e., baseline). OOemg activity was analyzed further as long duration activity (OOemgL), defined as continuous epochs lasting more than 200 ms and short duration activity (OOemgS) that lasted less than 200 ms. OOemg activity was assessed by 2-way ANOVA corrected for repeated measures on one factor. Significant treatment effects were assessed by Newman-Keuls after ANOVA. The data were presented as mean ± SEM, and the significant level set at P < 0.05. Power analyses based on previous studies of OOemg activity17,23 indicated that a sample size of n = 5 per treatment group would provide 80% power at P < 0.05.
Total RNA was extracted from anterior eye segment samples (cornea plus conjunctiva) and trigeminal ganglia (TG) of sham and DE rats using an RNA kit (Absolutely RNA; Agilent Technologies, La Jolla, CA, USA). cDNA was synthesized from 300 ng of each sample using a cDNA synthesis kit (iScript; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). qPCR was performed in triplicate on 2 μL cDNA with a DNA engine (Chromo4; Bio-Rad Laboratories) using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories). PCR conditions were as follows: an initial denaturation at 95°C for 3 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 10 seconds, 58.5°C for 20 seconds, and 72°C for 30 seconds. Data were analyzed using the delta CT method against two reference genes (GAPDH and UBC). Primer sets were as follows: GAPDH: F: 5′-agacagccgcatcttcttgt-3′, R: 5′-cttgccgtgggtagagtcat-3′. TRPV1: F: 5′-ctgctcctggacgttgcccg-3′, R: 5′-ccagcgtcatgttccgccgt-3′, TRPM8: F: 5′aggacttggcagaacagcta-3′, R: 5′aggaaattctggaccccagc-3′. A melting curve was employed to ensure amplicon fidelity.

Samples were homogenized in 0.5 mL cold lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10 mM EGTA, 10 mM EDTA, TBS pH 7.4, protease inhibitor cocktail [complete mini; Roche Diagnostic Operations, Indianapolis, IN, USA]). Homogenates were centrifuged at 4°C for 10 minutes at 12,000 g, and the supernatant retained. Protein concentration was determined by BCA assay (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc., Rockford, IL, USA), and 25 μg protein was separated on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to a 0.45 μM nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Membranes were blocked and incubated at 4°C overnight in TRPV1 receptor antibody (1:1000, lot# ACC029AN0550; Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) or TRPM8 antibody (1:1000, lot# SA2318285; Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) followed by goat anti-rabbit IRDye 680 (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA). Proteins were visualized using an infrared scanner (Odyssey; LI-COR) and arbitrary optical density was determined. Normalizing controls were utilized by simultaneous staining with beta-tubulin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) followed by goat anti-mouse IRDye 800 secondary antibody (LI-COR).

Immunoprecipitation was performed to confirm and compare results from western blots using a commercial kit (Pierce Classic IP Kit; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). Briefly, anterior eye and TG samples (150 mg) from sham and DE rats were homogenized and incubated with 2 μg of antibody for TRPV1 and TRPM8 as noted above. Protein-antibody complexes were separated from homogenate with protein A/G agarose, dissociated with loading buffer and separated on an 8% to 20% precast gel (Protean TGX; Bio-Rad Laboratories) in a mini cell (Mini Protean Tetra Cell; Bio-Rad Laboratories). The gel was removed and stained with a commercial stain (GelCode Blue Safe Protein Stain; Thermo Fisher Scientific) before imaging.
Sham and DE rats displayed normal weight gain after surgery and no overt signs of ocular hyperemia or inflammation. Spontaneous tear volume was measured in 82 rats (sham, n = 39; DE, n = 43). Tear volume was reduced ipsilateral to gland removal (8.63 ± 0.18 mm/2 minutes), compared to the contralateral eye (19.02 ± 0.28 mm/2 minutes) and compared to the left and right eyes of sham rats (19.31 ± 0.3 and 19.26 ± 0.27 mm/2 minutes), respectively, (F1,80 = 310, P < 0.001).
Ocular application of NaCl evoked dose-related increases in eye wipes in sham and DE rats (F2,20 = 13. 76, P < 0.001, Fig. 2A). At the highest concentration (2.5 M) eye wipe behavior was significantly greater in DE than sham rats (F1,30 = 11.5, P < 0.001). Similarly, capsaicin evoked a dose-related increase in eye wipes in sham and DE rats (F2,24 = 16.08, P < 0.001, Fig. 2B). Eye wipes increased after 0.327 μM (0.0001%) and 3.27 μM (0.001%) capsaicin in DE rats, while only the higher dose–evoked eye wipes in sham animals (treatment main effects, F1,12 = 9.34, P < 0.01). To determine if HS increased pore dilation or corneal permeability, sham and DE rats received QX-314 (2%), HS (2.5 M) or coapplication of QX-314 and HS. The results in Figure 2C revealed that QX-314 alone did not affect eye wipe behavior, while HS increased eye wipes in sham (F2,20 =14.1, P < 0.005) and DE rats (F2,20 = 25.4, P < 0.001). Coapplication of QX-314 plus HS greatly reduced eye wipes in DE (P < 0.01), but not in sham rats. Menthol (20, 100, and 200 μM) did not affect eye wipe behavior in sham or DE rats compared to vehicle application (F3,42 = 1.90, P > 0.1, Fig. 2D). Results after prior application of TRPV1 or TRPM8 receptor antagonists on HS-evoked eye wipe behavior were inconclusive since it was not possible to control drug exposure as the rat began eye wiping after antagonist application. Most rats displayed partial or full eyelid closure after HS or capsaicin; however, this was not quantified. Rats tested for eye wiping behavior also were included in OOemg recording sessions 2 days later.
In an initial series (n = 3), pairs of wire electrodes were positioned in the upper and lower portions of the OO muscle to determine the relative magnitude and timing of HS-evoked OOemg. The pattern and timing of responses were similar; however, the magnitude of OOemg recorded from the lower OO muscle was greater than from the upper OO muscle (F4,16 = 9.23, P < 0.001) as shown in Figure 3A. Since OOemg activity increased in upper and lower OO muscles, a single wire electrode was placed in each OO portion in subsequent experiments. As seen in Figure 3B, HS-evoked OOemg activity consisted of an initial sustained period of activity (OOemgL, >200 ms) followed by multiple periods of short duration activity (OOemgS, < 200 ms). The dashed vertical lines in Figure 3B indicate time segments of OOemgL and OOemgS that are expanded in Figures 3C and ​and3D,3D, respectively. Total OOemg activity increased after HS in a concentration-related manner in sham (Fig. 4A, F2,54 = 9.43, P < 0.001) and DE animals (Fig. 4B, F2,54 = 60.8, P < 0.001). In sham animals, OOemgL represented ∼41% of the total OOemg response and increased further with higher concentrations of HS (F2,54 = 4.58, P < 0.025). In DE animals, OOemgL represented ∼79% of the total OOemg response and displayed a much greater increase with higher HS concentrations (F2,54 = 46.1, P < 0.001). HS stimulation did not affect short duration OOemg (OOemgS) in sham or DE rats (Fig. 4).
Capsaicin alone evoked dose-related increases in total OOemg in sham and DE rats (F3,24 = 25.9, P < 0.001) that were different between animal groups (treatment main effect, F1,8 = 6.85, P < 0.05, Fig. 5).
The highest dose of menthol (200 μM) caused small (>2 μV-s/3 minutes), but significant, increases in total OOemg activity in sham (F3,24 = 5.12, P < 0.01) and DE rats (F3,24 = 4.62, P < 0.025, Fig. 6). However, at this concentration menthol likely is no longer specific for TRPM8 channels.27
Three approaches were used to assess the role of TRPV1 in mediating OOemg responses to HS. In the first series, capsazepine (100 μM), a nonselective TRPV1 antagonist, significantly reduced HS-evoked total OOemg activity in sham and DE rats (treatment main effect, F1,9 = 50.9, P < 0.001, Fig. 7). Capsazepine reduced HS-evoked OOemgL only in DE rats (F1,9 = 24.9, P < 0.001; sham, F1,9 = 1.12, P > 0.1, Fig. 7B), whereas OOemgS activity was not affected. Second, the highly selective TRPV1 antagonist, AMG9810, reduced HS-evoked OOemgL activity in sham and DE rats (main effect, F1,8 = 95.9, P < 0.001, Fig. 8). HS-evoked OOemgL activity was greatly reduced by AMG9810 in DE (F1,8 = 95.9, P < 0.001, Fig. 8B) and marginally reduced in sham rats (F1,8 = 5.73, p < 0.05, Fig. 8A). Short duration OOemgS activity was not reduced by AMG9810.
Third, we adapted the method of Binshtok et al.28 to selectively block voltage-gated sodium channels of TRPV1-expressing corneal nerves by coadministration of QX-314 and low-dose capsaicin (0.327 or 3.27 μM) 30 minutes prior to HS. As seen in Figure 9A, coapplication of 3.27 μM capsaicin with 2% QX-314 caused a significant reduction in HS-evoked total OOemgL activity in sham rats (F4,21 = 5.29, P < 0.005), whereas 0.327 μM capsaicin plus QX-314 had only a minor effect. By contrast, coapplication of 0.327 μM or 3.27 μM capsaicin plus QX-314 significantly reduced HS-evoked OOemgL activity in DE rats (F4,22 = 9.27, P < 0.001, Fig. 9B). Note that administration of 3.27 μM capsaicin alone 30 minutes earlier did not affect HS-evoked OOemgL responses in sham or DE rats. HS-evoked OOemgS activity was not affected by capsaicin plus QX-314 in sham or DE rats (data not shown).
Prior application of the selective TRPM8 receptor antagonist, AMTB (10–50 μM), significantly reduced the HS-evoked OOemg response in sham (F3,21 = 6.10, P < 0.005) and DE rats (F3,21 = 5.95, P < 0.005, Fig. 10). The effect of AMTB on HS-evoked total OOemg activity was greater in DE than sham rats (F1,7 = 9.15, P < 0.025).
Anterior eye samples of sham and 14-day DE rats expressed similar levels of TRPV1 (F1,5 = 6.22, P < 0.1) and TRPM8 (F1,5 = 5.25, P < 0.1). By contrast, TRPV1 protein levels were increased in DE versus sham rats (F1,4 = 10.8, P < 0.05), while TRPM8 protein levels were similar (F1,7 = 0.65, P > 0.1). Trigeminal ganglion (TG) expression of TRPV1 (F1,6 = 0.22, P > 0.1) and TRPM8 (F1,6 = 0.84, P > 0.1) were similar for sham and DE rats. However, TRPV1 protein levels increased and were greater in DE than sham rats (22.1 ± 8 vs. 2.2 ± 1 arbitrary units [AU], n = 4 per group, F1,6 = 13.7, P < 0.025). Protein levels for TRPM8 were similar for DE and sham rats (2.5 ± 1.3 vs. 0.2 ± 0.1 AU, n = 4 per group, F1,6 = 2.1, P > 0.1). Immunoprecipitation confirmed the increases in TRPV1 protein from anterior eye samples (sham versus DE = 2.08 and 4.81 relative intensity, respectively) and TG (sham versus DE = 2.29 and 4.09, respectively). Values for TRPM8 protein were low compared to TRPV1 in anterior eye samples (sham versus DE = 1.52 and 0.86 relative intensity, respectively) and TG (sham versus DE = 1.16 and 1.83 relative intensity, respectively, Fig. 11).
A challenge for translational research concerned with mechanisms of chronic pain in humans has been the measurement of animal behavior with predictive value.29 This has been particularly true for studies of ocular pain since there are few options for measuring ocular-evoked aversive behaviors in animals that can be reasonably interpreted as ocular pain in humans. The present study measured forelimb eye wiping behavior in conscious animals and then recorded OOemg responses in anesthetized rats to identical stimuli that are known to cause ocular pain in humans. The results revealed good correspondence between evoked eye wipe behavior and either total or long duration OOemg (OOemgL) activity. Ocular stimuli known to cause pain in humans (e.g., HS and capsaicin) evoked robust concentration-dependent increases in eye wiping in conscious rats and OOemgL activity in anesthetized rats and were significantly greater in DE than sham rats.

Eye blink frequency has often been used as a marker for ocular discomfort in DE. Spontaneous blink rates are elevated in patients30–32 and animal models of DE.15,33,34 Although manual counts of HS-evoked eye blinks were enhanced in DE rats,17 blinking also was enhanced after neutral saline35 and menthol36 in DE animals suggesting that eye blink frequency is not specific for nocifensive behavior and without videographic confirmation, is difficult to quantify.37 By contrast, squint-like behavior seen as a sustained eyelid closure in response to noxious stimuli has been used to determine the threshold light intensity for photophobia in normal subjects.38 In conscious rats, ocular application of HS at concentrations similar to the present study caused sustained eyelid closure in a concentration-related manner as assessed by videography.39 Collectively, these data supported the notion that sustained OOemgL activity evoked by HS and capsaicin in anesthetized rats was a valid marker for squint-like behavior in conscious animals.

The tears of DE patients contain several factors able to increase the activity of corneal nociceptors, such as hyperosmolarity and proinflammatory molecules,13,18 and drive ocular pain sensation. A second aim of this study was to determine if TRPV1 and TRPM8 ion channel receptors contributed to the enhanced OOemgL activity in DE rats. TRPV1 is gated by protons, heat, and hyperosmolar solutions40 and is expressed by 30% to 50% of corneal nerves.41,42 A majority of corneal polymodal nociceptors are gated by protons, heat, and hyperosmolar solutions.43–45 Psychophysical studies report that acidic46,47 or hyperosmolar solutions22,48 sufficient to cause burning pain in humans also excite corneal polymodal nociceptors in animals. Three approaches were used to demonstrate that TRPV1 activation contributes to HS-evoked OOemgL activity: application of a nonselective TRPV1 antagonist (capsazepine), selective TRPV1 antagonist (AMG9810) and coapplication of subthreshold dose of capsaicin plus the charged lidocaine derivative, QX-314. Each approach significantly reduced HS-evoked OOemgL activity and suggested a key role for TRPV1 in mediating HS-evoked OOemg activity. Although ∼10% of corneal nerves express TRPM8,42 are activated cool temperatures and moderate increases in osmolarity,48,49–52 TRPM8 is inhibited by inflammation.53 Moderate concentrations of menthol (100 μM) did not induce eye wipe behavior or OOemg activity, although higher nonselective concentrations did evoke HS-evoked responses in sham and DE animals. This may be explained by coexpression of TRPM8 and TRPV1 or other receptors in a minority of corneal afferents.42 In conclusion, evoked OOemg activity is valid measure of aversive behavior suitable for use in anesthetized animal preparations. Although TRPV1 and TRPM8 are gated by hyperosmolarity, at osmotic concentrations that evoke pain sensation, TRPV1 alone is sufficient to account for ocular pain.

Nitrate and certain short chain nitrocompounds and nitro-oxy compounds are being investigated as dietary supplements to reduce economic and environmental costs associated with ruminal methane emissions. Thermodynamically, nitrate is a preferred electron acceptor in the rumen that consumes electrons at the expense of methanogenesis during dissimilatory reduction to an intermediate, nitrite, which is primarily reduced to ammonia although small quantities of nitrous oxide may also be produced. Short chain nitrocompounds act as direct inhibitors of methanogenic bacteria although certain of these compounds may also consume electrons at the expense of methanogenesis and are effective inhibitors of important foodborne pathogens. Microbial and nutritional consequences of incorporating nitrate into ruminant diets typically results in increased acetate production. Unlike most other methane-inhibiting supplements, nitrate decreases or has no effect on propionate production. The type of nitrate salt added influences rates of nitrate reduction, rates of nitrite accumulation and efficacy of methane reduction, with sodium and potassium salts being more potent than calcium nitrate salts. Digestive consequences of adding nitrocompounds to ruminant diets are more variable and may in some cases increase propionate production. Concerns about the toxicity of nitrate's intermediate product, nitrite, to ruminants necessitate management, as animal poisoning may occur via methemoglobinemia. Certain of the naturally occurring nitrocompounds, such as 3-nitro-1-propionate or 3-nitro-1-propanol also cause poisoning but via inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase. Typical risk management procedures to avoid nitrite toxicity involve gradually adapting the animals to higher concentrations of nitrate and nitrite, which could possibly be used with the nitrocompounds as well. A number of organisms responsible for nitrate metabolism in the rumen have been characterized. To date a single rumen bacterium is identified as contributing appreciably to nitrocompound metabolism. Appropriate doses of the nitrocompounds and nitrate, singly or in combination with probiotic bacteria selected for nitrite and nitrocompound detoxification activity promise to alleviate risks of toxicity. Further studies are needed to more clearly define benefits and risk of these technologies to make them saleable for livestock producers.

Keywords: nitrate, nitrocompounds, rumen, methane reduction, nitrate toxicity

Nitrate and other oxidized nitrocompounds are scientifically pursued due to their toxicity and ability to reduce enteric methane emissions by ruminants. Methane production by microbes within the rumen is recognized as a fermentative inefficiency resulting in the loss of 2–12% of the gross energy consumed by the host (Johnson and Johnson, 1995). Environmentally, methaneis a significant greenhouse gas and strategies are sought to reduce its emission from livestock, which in the United States accounts for 95% of anthropogenic methane emissions arising from enteric fermentation (US EPA, 2012). However, despite its negative association with energy retention and greenhouse gas emissions, methanogenesis plays an important ecological role in the rumen. Archaea consume hydrogen emitted by bacterial and protozoal hydrogenases functioning to reoxidize reduced nucleotides produced during glycolysis and other catabolic pathways (Ellis et al., 1990; Miller, 1995). Methanogenesis functions to maintain a low partial pressure of hydrogen, which at partial pressures above 1 kPa promote end-product inhibition of NADH oxidoreductase thereby disrupting the oxidation of NADH and depleting concentrations of NAD to levels that inhibit fermentation (Miller, 1995; Van Nevel and Demeyer, 1996; Hegarty and Gerdes, 1999).

It is generally recognized that the most effective methane-inhibiting interventions provide alternative mechanisms for maintaining low partial pressures of dihydrogen within the rumen. A variety of electron accepting substrates are available for use as alternative electron acceptors for anaerobic respiration in the rumen, including unsaturated fatty acids, nitrate, sulfate or fumarate (Leng, 2014). From a thermodynamic perspective, however, the use of nitrate is particularly attractive because the dissimilatory reduction to ammonia is energetically more favorable (ΔG0′ = −600 kJ/mol) than the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane (ΔG0′ = −136 kJ/mol) and the reduction of other electron acceptors available in an anaerobic environment (Thauer et al., 1977; Table ​Table1).1). Moreover, supplemental nitrate could under certain dietary conditions serve and perhaps even replace nonprotein nitrogen sources such as urea to support microbial protein synthesis in the rumen (Carver and Pfander, 1974; Sophea and Preston, 2011; Li et al., 2012; Silivong et al., 2012; Thanh et al., 2012). Theoretically, the consumption of four electrons with the reduction of nitrate to nitrous oxide, and potential consumption of an additional electron for the reduction of nitrous oxide to dinitrogen (N2) via denitrification, could also serve as a metabolic route for electron disposal to the reduction of nitrate. However, from an energetic perspective, the reduction of nitrite to ammonia is slightly more favorable thermodynamically than the reduction of nitrite to nitrous oxide (436 kJ/mol vs. 453 kJ/mol), and thus ammonia is the prevalent reduction product in the rumen (Table ​(Table11).
Early work by Anderson et al. (1993, 1997) revealed that like nitrate and nitrite, the naturally-occurring nitrocompounds 3-nitro-1-propionate and 3-nitro-1-propanol and industrially-produced nitroethane may also serve as electron acceptors within rumen microbial populations. However, in addition to serving as alternative electron acceptors these nitrocompounds also exert a direct inhibition of ruminal methanogenesis (Anderson and Rasmussen, 1998; Gutierrez-Bañuelos et al., 2008). Consumption of electrons, at least with the reduction of naturally occurring nitrocompounds and nitroethane, occurs more slowly than the direct inhibition mechanism and requires in situ enrichment of competent nitro-reducing bacteria that are normally present at low numbers. The biological processes involved in the direct chemical inhibition of methane production by the short chain nitrocompounds are ill-defined. It has been speculated that this could occur via inhibition of electron transfer reactions like the nitroethanol-caused inhibition of electron transfer between ferredoxin and hydrogenase (Angermaier and Simon, 1983; Anderson et al., 2008). A number of other short chain nitrocompounds have been tested in vitro and while most if not all have been found to effectively inhibit ruminal methane production at present only a few have been found to be suitable electron acceptors for supporting growth of nitro-reducing bacteria. Alternatively, inhibition of methyl-coenzyme M reductase of methanogenic bacteria has been postulated for the recently identified inhibitor, 3-nitrooxypropanol, as well as some other nitro-oxy-compounds (Martínez-Fernández et al., 2014; Prakash, 2014). Thus, these nitro-oxy compounds, which possess an oxygen atom binding the nitro-group at the number 3 carbon, not only differ structurally from the short chain nitrocompounds discussed above, but probably in their mode of action as well.

Multiple literature reviews on the toxicological aspects and methane reducing potential of feeding nitrate to ruminants have been published recently including excellent works by Lee and Beauchemin (2014) and Leng (2008). Consequently, the present work focuses our discusssions on the microbiological response to nitrate and nitrocompound supplementation
Microbial reduction of nitrate can occur by dissimilatory and assimilatory processes. The genes involved, their regulation and the energetics of these pathways substantialy differ (Table ​(Table2).2). The assimilatory nitrate reduction pathway consumes energy to reduce nitrate to ammonia as a nitrogen source for microbial protein synthesis and is repressed by ammonia (Moreno-Vivián et al., 1999). Consequently, the functional role of this process is largely unnecessary in environments like the rumen where the availability of ammonia may down regulate this activity. Dissimilatory nitrate reduction, on the other hand, is an energy generating process that is distributed widely amoung obligate and facultative anaerobic bacteria (Thauer et al., 1977). Within the rumen, dissimilatory nitrate reduction occurs primarily via a two-step pathway where nitrate is first reduced to nitrite, which can accumulate as an intermedite before it is ultimately reduced to ammonia. Enzymes involved in dissimilatory nitrate reduction include membrane bound and periplasmc nitrate reductases encoded by nar and nap genes and nitrite reductases encoded by nir and nrf genes (Thauer et al., 1977; Moreno-Vivián et al., 1999; Table ​Table2).2). Dissimilatory nitritereduction occurs on the outer cytoplasmic membrane and depending on the organism, consumes electrons via the oxidation of reduced electron carriers such as NADH or FADH and upon subsequent transfer of these electrons to the respiratory electron transport system they can be used to reduce and thus detoxify nitrite (Thauer et al., 1977; Moreno-Vivián et al., 1999). Certain bacteria may lack a complete functional electron transport chain yet be able to reduce nitrate to nitrite and sometimes to ammonia via reductive reactions with the incomplete chain or other electron carriers without generating ATP. In such cases, these bacteria are thought to still gain an energetic benefit via more effective disposal of electrons and therefore more efficient recycling of NAD via oxidation of NADH produced during glycolysis (Hasan and Hall, 1975).
Denitrification is another pathway for dissimilatory nitrate reduction, yet despite evidence for the presence of the denitrifying genes (nir, nor, and nos) within the rumen eubacterial and archaeal metagenome (Zumft and Kroneck, 2007; Brulc et al., 2009), this process is not considered to contribute appreciably to ruminal nitrate reduction (Jones, 1972; Kaspar and Tiedje, 1981; Leng, 2008; Table ​Table2).2). In a metagenomic study by Brulc et al. (2009), 85 occurances of genes associated with denifrication and nitrogen fixation were tagged in bovine rumen metagenomics samples compared to the occurance of 636 genes contributing to nitrate and nitrite ammonification and 1233 total genes contributing to nitrogen metabolism. Thus, the authors concluded that denitrification and nitrogen fixation activities were likely inconsequential in the rumen. However, genetically this accounts for 7% of the genes involved in nitrogen metabolism and while clearly not dominant, their contribution cannot be completely ruled out.

Few studies have measured ruminal nitrous oxide accumulation in response to nitrate supplementation, however, in studies that have the amounts produced were found to vary considerably. Nitrous oxide concentrations equivalent to 0.3% the amount of added nitrate or nitrite were measured within nitrate- or nitrite-supplemented in vitro rumen fluid incubations and in vivo from the rumen of nitrate-supplemented [as 5 Ca(NO3).2NH4NO.310 H2O] sheep (Kaspar and Tiedje, 1981; de Raphélis-Soissan et al., 2014). However, Petersen et al. (2015) found nitrous oxide emissions account for as much as 3.4% of added nitrate (21 g NO3kg−1 dry matter fed to adapted dairy cows, nitrate type unknown). The later evidence suggests that denitrification may be contributing to nitrous oxide production in the rumen rather than being produced simply as a nonspecific byproduct of dissimilatory nitrite reduction by the nir nitrite reductase as postulated by Kaspar and Tiedje (1981). Potential bacterial denitrifiers are Pseudomonas aeruginosa and certain species of Propionibacterium and Nitrosomonas, which in the absence of added nitrate may be considered transient or minor colonizers of the rumen (Bryant, 1959; Duncan et al., 1999; Mitsumori et al., 2002; Arai et al., 2003). Future meta-transcriptomic analysis and/or RT-qPCR combined with nitrous oxide emission measurements could determine the relative abundance and gene expression of the denitrification pathways within the rumen of animals adapted to different types and amounts of nitrate.
Microbial nitrate and nitrite metabolism in the rumen is a paradox in that it enables detoxification, but also results in the formation of toxicants (Table ​(Table3).3). Since these microbes are symbionts to the ruminant host, an understanding of both their response in terms of gene expression and community structure and their susceptibility to added nitrate and nitrite becomes exceedingly important. Exposure of unadapted microbial populations to high intakes of dietary nitrate results in the rapid induction of nitrate reducing activity, as evidenced by >14-fold increases in activity within 4 h of first exposure, as well as the gradual selection of highly competent nitrate and nitrite reducing rumen bacteria (Allison and Reddy, 1984). Induction of nitrate and nitrite metabolism by prominent fermentative bacteria in the rumen such as Selenomonas ruminantium as well as members belonging to Butyrivibrio, Clostridium, Peptostreptococcus, and Propionibacterium can readily and rapidly contribute enhanced nitrate reduction capabilities (Alaboudi, 1984; Iwamoto et al., 2002). Subsequent to induction of nitrate and nitrite reducing activity, these bacteria can be enriched in number via exposure to nitrate because of the greater energy yield from electron transport mediated phosphorylation of ADP to ATP or via achieval of more effective electron disposal (Hasan and Hall, 1975; Thauer et al., 1977; Moreno-Vivián et al., 1999). The contribution of propionibacteria to ruminal nitrate reduction is probably atypical, however, as most nitrate-reducing propionibacteria are denitrifiers that produce nitrous oxide as an end product (Kaspar, 1982). Wolinella succinogenes may be considered a specialist in that it is nonfermentative and exhibits highly active nitrate and nitrite reducing activity. Nitrate-utilizing Veillenolla parvula also contribute to ruminal nitrate and nitrite metabolism however the abundance of these populations appears to be dependent on nitrate concentrations (Asanuma et al., 2002; Iwamoto et al., 2002). A number of other nitrate-reducing bacteria, such as certain species of Desulfovibrio and members of family Enterobacteriaceae can inhabit the rumen, albeit at low abundance, and it is reasonable to suspect these bacteria could also be enriched during prolonged exposure to nitrate (Pfennig et al., 1981; Stewart, 1988). Certain members of Enterobacteriaceae, such as entertoxigenic and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli and numerous Salmonella enterica serovars, are important animal or foodborne pathogens and thus their enrichment due to nitrate feeding would be undesirable, although to our knowledge this has not yet been reported.

Evidence for enrichment of nitrate-reducing bacterial populations also comes from studies of Alaboudi and Jones (1985), who reported >3-fold increases in rates of ruminal nitrate and nitrite metabolism in goats adapted to approximately 1.5 g nitrate (as KNO3) kg−1 body weight which coincided with a 3-fold increase in the proportion of nitrate-reducing bacteria. Unfortunately, they did not further characterize their isolated bacteria and the identity of nitrate-reducers was not reported (Alaboudi and Jones, 1985). More recently, Asanuma et al. (2015) reported 2.3–2.8-fold increases in nitrate and nitrite reducing activity following adaptation to a diet supplying approximately 0.18 g nitrate (as KNO3) kg−1 body weight per day to goats. Concomitant with this increase in nitrate and nitrite reducing activity were nearly equivalent increases in the relative abundance of narG and nrfA gene sequences specific for the nitrate reducing bacterium, Selenomonas ruminantium, as well this bacterium's 16S rRNA gene (Asanuma et al., 2015).

Conversely, Lin et al. (2013a) found no differences in abundance of nar or of 16S rRNA genes specific to S. ruminantium or to the less abundant nitrate-reducers V. parvula and W. succinogenes in rumen contents from nitrate nitrogen-fed steers (0.22–0.31 g nitrate kg−1 body weight, fed as KNO3) when compared to urea nitrogen-fed steers. Unfortunately, rates of nitrate and nitrite metabolism were not reported so comparison of abundance measurents to activity measurements is not possible. They did, however, observe increases in populations of the nitrate-reducers Campylobacter fetus, which was enriched in both liquid and solid fractions of ruminal contents, and Mannheimia succiniciproducens, which was enriched only in the liquid fraction collected from the rumen (Lin et al., 2013a). More recently, Zhao et al. (2015) proposed that Campylobacter and cyanobacteria were important nitrate-reducing taxa based on results from 16s rDNA sequencing. Campylobacter fetus is an important pathogen affecting ruminants and thus its enrichment would be undesirable. Conversely, M. succiniciproducens may be an attractive bacterium to enrich in the rumen because it has considerable potential fix carbon dioxide, via carboxylation of phospoenolpyruvate (Lee et al., 2006). Even after enrichment, however, C. fetus and M. succiniciproducens made up only a small proportion (< 0.1%) of the total population (Lin et al., 2013a). Moreover, the study of Lin et al. (2013a) was a cross-over design, however, with a 12 day wash-out period between nitrate-nitrogen and urea-nitrogen treatments which may have been insufficient to allow populations to re-achieve unperturbed densities. It was not stated if the animals had opportunity to physically contact one another during provision of the respective treatments, but if they had then induction or transfer of nitrate and nitrite reductive capacity could have occurred between groups of animals as has been as reported by Majak and Cheng (1984) and Cheng et al. (1985). In these earlier experiments, animals in treated groups received daily doses of nitrate intraruminally (0.1 g nitrate kg−1 body weight, salt unspecified) during the treatment period and were initially kept away from animals in the untreated control group (Majak and Cheng, 1984; Cheng et al., 1985). Then both groups were housed in adjacent pens while the treated group continued to receive the nitrate supplement. Despite receiving no nitrate, the control group of steers showed increased (80–200%) nitrate and nitrite reduction rates during the contact period. The authors hypothesized this transfer may have been mediated via horizontal gene transfer of plasmids containing nitrate reductase (Majak and Cheng, 1984; Cheng et al., 1985). However, this could also originate from other mobile genetic elements such as transposons or bacteriophages, oral transfer of microbes via animal licking, or some other signaling molecule that we are unaware of that would induce the upregulation of nitrate and nitrite reducing genes in the ruminal microbial population.

Exposure of ruminal populations of bacteria to nitrate not only selects for nitrate-reducing bacteria, but also acts as a selection mechanism for a different ecological makeup within the microbial community. Marais et al. (1988), using in vitro cultivation techniques, reported that nitrite accumulation resulting from reduction of added nitrate (approximately 26 g nitrate kg−1 dry matter; added as KNO3) decreased ruminal cellulolytic activity. They concluded that the decrease in cellulolytic activity was a result of 64, 25, and 57% decreases in numbers of cellulolytic, xylanolytic and total viable bacteria, respectively, as determined via viable cell count on selective media. Others also have observed toxic effects of nitrite, produced as an intermediate during the reduction of nitrate, on populations of cellulolytic bacteria as well as on other microbial populations including methanogens (Iwamoto et al., 2002; Zhou et al., 2011, 2012; Asanuma et al., 2015). The inhibition of cellulolytic organisms may explain the decreases in dry matter intake sometimes observed in animals feed nitrate-supplemented diets (Newbold et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2015a,b). It is recognized that decreased cellulolysis can decrease rates and extent of neutral detergent fiber digestion thus increasing rumen retention time of a forage and negatively affective rumen fill, both which can cause decreased dry matter intake (Allen, 2000). It is well known that nitrate and nitrite additions cause a shift in volatile fatty acid concentration, sometimes disproportionately against branched-chain volatile fatty acids essential for certain bacterial populations, and this has been suggested as a reason for decreases observed in total bacterial populations and particularly cellulolytic bacteria (Allison and Reddy, 1984) but this was discounted by Marais et al. (1988).

In the case of methanogens, the reduction of nitrate preferentially consumes electrons at the expense of methanogenesis. However, methanogens also appear to be particularly sensitive to the toxic effects of nitrite, with 50% inhibition in cell growth occurring with as little as 0.5 mM nitrite (Iwamoto et al., 2002). Asanuma et al. (2015) similarly found methanogens, as well as total populations of rumen bacteria, protozoa and fungi to be greatly decreased in vivo after goats were fed a high nitrate diet (5.4 g nitrateday−1, as KNO3) for 2 weeks. This total community depression may result from the oxidizing nature of nitrite as it relates to its antimicrobial properties, attributed to inactivation or inhibition of sulfur containing constituents involved in energy metabolism, DNA replication or maintenance of cell wall integrity (Marais et al., 1988; Cammack et al., 1999).

The high reactivity of nitrite could also disrupt the low E°/mV within the rumen as evidenced in the study of Jamieson (1959), who found that sheep intraruminally dosed with 25 g nitrate (as KNO3) had a higher Eh value pre-dose than 2 h post dose (−225 vs. −70 mV, respectively). As reported by Kalachniuk et al. (1978) and discussed by Zhou et al. (2012), an increase in reduction potential (Eh) has been reported to be inhibitory to some rumen bacteria, notably S. ruminantium, Bacteroides amylophilus, Fibrobacter (Bacteroides) succinogenes and Streptococcus bovis. More recently, however, an increased Eh was found to be not particularly inhibitory per se to these same bacterial species (Marounek and Wallace, 1984), but it could potentially perturb thermodynamic control of important oxidation/reduction reactions such as those involved in electron transfer. For instance, Marais et al. (1988) reported that nitrate-caused inhibition of forage digestibility could not be overcome by using the reducing agent cysteine to decrease the nitrite-caused increase in culture Eh. Thus, they proposed a direct effect of nitrite on inhibiting bacterial growth, and while they at the time suggested this inhibition appeared to be most potent against bacteria with electron transport linked phosphorylation capabilities, more recent evidence suggest the toxic effect may not be so specific. In the study of Asanuma et al. (2015) for instance, they found that populations of major the cellulolytic bacteria F. succinogenes, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, which contain electron transport capabilities, as well Ruminococus albus, which does not contain electron transport capabilities, all decreased in the rumen of goats fed nitrate. Zhou et al. (2012) also reported reductions in abundance of F. succinogenes, R. flavefaciens, and R. albus as well as in archaeal, but not total bacterial populations when measured by real-time PCR during in vitro incubations of mixed populations of ruminal microbes with =12 mM sodium nitrate. They further found evidence of adaption or acquisition of tolerance by populations of R. albus as well as F. succinogenes, but not R. flavefaciens or the archaeal populations following up to 6 consecutive cultures with 12 mM added sodium nitrate (Zhou et al., 2012). Broad activity of nitrite was found in the studies of Iwamoto et al. (2002), who tested 15 different bacterial species and found that growth of all except four were inhibited by concentrations of 3–5 mM nitrite, with many being producers of hydrogen, formate or lactate that can contribute reductants for nitrate and nitrite reduction or methanogenesis (Russell and Rychlik, 2001). Decreases in populations of hydrogen, formate or lactate-producing microbes could potentially limit the availability of reductant for methanogenesis or nitrate respiration. However, Asanuma et al. (2015) observed significant increases in genetic abundance of the highly efficient sugar-fermenting bacterium, S. bovis. It is reasonable to speculate that the sugar-fermentation by S. bovis may contribute a pool of electron donating substrates for the nitrate-reducing population thus potentally compensating for the decreased reductant that would be expected by inhibition of the hydrogen, formate or lactate-producing microbes observed by Iwamoto et al. (2002).

In direct opposition to the findings discussed above, Zhao et al. (2015) found that added nitrate in vivo (1–2% dry matter, nitrate type unknown) was associated with an increase in many cellulolytic bacterial species including R. flavefaciens, R. albus, and F. succinogenes. The authors attributed this selection to nitrate-caused increase production and thus availability of branch chain fatty acids required by these bacteria. The authors did not specifically discuss why branched chain fatty acids were increased but it is reasonable to speculate that this may have occurred due to changes in microbial diversity in the rumen population.

The protozoa, which reduce nitrate to ammonia for assimilatory purposes, play an unclear role in the total nitrate metabolism in the rumen. The protozoal fractions showed similar rates of nitrate reduction with less nitrite accumulation without any adaptation period as compared to the whole rumen fraction or bacterial fraction (Yoshida et al., 1982; Iwamoto et al., 2001; Lin et al., 2011). In contrast, Allison and Reddy (1984) reported that the nitrate and nitrite reducing activity was not found in their protozoal fraction. Moreover, they also reported that the nitrate reducing activity in rumen contents was membrane bound and was inhibited by azide and hydroxyl quinolone-N-oxide, each inhibitors of electron carrier mediated respiration. The absence of nitrate-reducing activity when dissimilatory (respiratory) nitrate reduction was inhibited suggests that the assimilatory nitrate-reducing pathway, such as that by protozoa, was inoperative or contributed little to overall nitrate reduction. Future studies are needed to detect changes in the protozoal populations in the rumen from nitrate-fed ruminants as well as additional research exploring their potential, if any, to enhance nitrite removal and reduce methane production.
Additions of nitrate to in vitro incubations of mixed populations of ruminal microbes have generally resulted in decreased production of methane and propionate while sometimes increasing production of total volatile fatty acids; however, this varies considerably depending on experimental conditions (Bozic et al., 2009; Shi et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2012; Patra and Yu, 2014). The decreased production of more reduced fatty acids reflects a lesser need for this route of electron disposal because electrons are instead consumed for the reduction of nitrate to nitrite and ultimately to ammonia (Sutherland, 1977; Russell, 2002). Increased acetate production at the expense of butyrate can sometimes occur due to nitrate supplementation (Farra and Satter, 1971; Anderson and Rasmussen, 1998) and this could be due to the stimulation of more thermodynamically favorable pathways for electron disposal (Ungerfeld and Kohn, 2006).

The effects of nitrate feeding ultimately depend on nitrate concentration and its availability within the rumen which is not only affected by the amount fed but also by the type or source of nitrate fed which can markedly affect the ruminal availability of the free nitrate ion. Consequently, in vivo additions of nitrate have also resulted in variable effects on volatile fatty acid production and methane emissions as well as on methemoglobin development in studies measuring these responses (Table ​(Table4).4). For instance, encapsulated nitrate supplements used in the studies of Lee et al. (2015a,b) would be expected to release nitrate more slowly than the salt forms of nitrate, which themselves can differ in nitrate availability thus affecting their methane reducing potential and their toxicity. In studies using calcium nitrate, amounts consumed ranged from 0.26 to 0.94 g Ca(NO3)2kg−1 body weight, an amount sufficient to cause toxicity if an equivalent dose of sodium or potassium nitrate were fed (van Zijderveld et al., 2010, 2011; Hulshof et al., 2012; Li et al., 2012; de Raphélis-Soissan et al., 2014; El-Zaiat et al., 2014; Velazco et al., 2014). Likewise, calcium nitratewas the least effective at decreasing methane, 3.5% reduction when expressed as mmol−1 nitratekg−1 body weight, as compared to sodium and potassium nitrate which caused a 14.5 and 9.6% decrease in methane per mmol nitratekg−1 body weight respectively (Takahashi and Young, 1991; Sar et al., 2004, 2006; Nolan et al., 2010; van Zijderveld et al., 2010, 2011; Hulshof et al., 2012; Leng et al., 2012; Li et al., 2012; de Raphélis-Soissan et al., 2014; El-Zaiat et al., 2014; Velazco et al., 2014; Asanuma et al., 2015). Similarly, Phuong (2012) found that 24% less NaNO3 and 12% less KNO3 as compared to Ca(NO3)2 resulted in the same amount of methane production. This is most likely due to differences in solubility. Calcium has low solubility at pH above 5.5 and since the rumen pH seldom declines to below 5.5 it is likely that a significant portion of the calcium nitrate is unsolubilized and thus unavailable to exert the full effect of the nitrate. Additionally, the cation themselves (K, Na, and Ca) have important roles in the rumen including motility, osmolality, pH, acid base balance, and are known to influence the dry matter intake. As many of these nitrate salt feeding trials are feeding at level in excess of 2% of intake, there is the possibility that the accompanying cations may alter the microbiome and the animal physiology. Iso-cation diets controls may be necessary in future studies. Overall, it would be prudent to develop standards for nitrate salt feeding with stipulations for salt type, age of the animal, adaptation status, and previous exposure.
In global warming potential (GWP), carbon dioxide is 1, methane is 21, and nitrous oxide is 298 over a 100-year time scale. Therefore, even a small increase in nitrous oxide from nitrate reduction could have large effects on GWP. For example, nitrous oxide emission from sheep was higher when fed nitrate (calcinite at 0.625 g kg−1 body weight), which in turn lowered the net benefit of methane mitigation on global warming potential by 18% despite the nitrous oxide being only 0.3% of added nitrate (de Raphélis-Soissan et al., 2014). Likewise, Petersen et al. (2015) found a 28–23% reduction in overall decrease in global warming mitigation effect and Neumeier et al. (2014) found no net reduction in greenhouse gases when considering the increase in nitrous oxide from feeding nitrate.

Considering the cost and risk to the producers of feeding nitrate, the decrease of greenhouse gases production may not justify the usage of nitrate feeding as a methane mitigation strategy. Toxicity aside, it has been suggested that the limiting factors for the adoption of supplemental-nitrate feeding in beef production are financial in nature (Callaghan et al., 2014).
Unlike nitrate and nitrite metabolism, less is known about the mechanisms of nitrocompound metabolism by ruminal microbes. Nishino et al. (2010) isolated 3-nitro-1-propionate-degrading species of strictly aerobic Cupriavidus and Pseudomonas bacteria from soil and water. Considering, however, that their degradation of 3-nitro-1-propionate proceeded to yield to propionate-3-nitronate and ultimately malonic semialdehyde, nitrate, nitrite, and hydrogen peroxide, it is unlikely these aerobic bacteria contribute to nitrocompound degradation in the anaerobic rumen. In the rumen, the naturally occurring 3-nitro-1-propionic acid and 3-nitro-1-propanol are first hydrolyzed from their glucose conjugates by microbial esterase or β-glycosidase activity thereby liberating the aglycones from their respective esters or ether glycosides (Table ​(Table3),3), the latter which are rather innocuous (Anderson et al., 2005). Once liberated, 3-nitro-1-propionic acid and 3-nitro-1-propanol are available to be absorbed or further metabolized by bacteria in the rumen. The nitroacid is absorbed less rapidly but metabolized more rapidly than the nitroalcohol which thus explains why 3-nitro-1-propionic acid is less toxic than 3-nitro-1-propanol to ruminants.

Presently, the ruminal bacterium Denitrobacterium detoxificans is the only known anaerobe to exhibit appreciable nitroalkane-reducing activity (Anderson et al., 1996, 1997, 2000). This bacterium conserves energy for growth exclusively via anaerobic respiration, oxidizing hydrogen, formate or lactate in the reduction of nitrate to ammonia and the reduction of 3-nitro-1-propionic acid, 3-nitro-1-propanol, and nitroethane to β-alanine, 3-amino-1-propanol and aminoethane, respectively (Anderson et al., 1993, 1997, 2000). β-alanine was rapidly metabolized to unknown products in mixed populations of ruminal microbes but 3-amino-1-propanol appeared to be a terminal product (Anderson et al., 1993). Early research by Looper et al. (1959) indicated that β-alanine was appreciably deaminated in the rumen but little other information is available on its fate as an endproduct. The reduction of the nitroalkanes to their amines is presumed to consume six moles electrons per mol of amino group reduced and is based on the stoichiometry reported for the reduction of nitroethanol to ethanolamine (Angermaier and Simon, 1983). Denitrobacterium detoxificans can also grow on dimethyl sulfoxide and trimethyl amine oxide, reducing these acceptors to dimethylsulfide and trimethyl amine, and can grow, albeit less readily, on nitroethanol, 2-nitro-4-butanol, 1-nitropropane and 2-nitro-1-propanol (Anderson et al., 2000). The fate of these later four substrates has not been investigated. With respect to these nitrocompounds, all except 2-nitro-4-butanol and 1-nitropropane have been tested and found to be potent inhibitors of ruminal methanogenesis (Anderson and Rasmussen, 1998; Anderson et al., 2003, 2008, 2010). Evidence indicates that D. detoxificans can effectively contribute to detoxification of 3-nitro-1-propionic acid, 3-nitro-1-propanol, which exist as phytotoxins in certain leguminous plants, notably milkvetchs belonging to the genera Astragalus and Coronilla (Anderson et al., 2005). However, with little known about the physiology and nutritional requirements more research is needed to make growing this bacterium practical for large scale applications.

More recently, chemically synthesized dimethyl-2-nitroglutarate and 2-nitro-methyl-propionate have also been tested and found to be similarly potent anti-methanogenic compounds (Anderson et al., 2010) as has ethyl nitroacetate (data not shown); however, the fate of these three nitrocompounds within incubations of mixed populations of rumen bacteria has not been determined.

From a thermodynamic perspective, Gibbs free energy values for the reduction of the nitrocompounds to their respective amines have not been determined. However, experimentally, nitrate was preferentially reduced by mixed populations of bovine ruminal microbes compared to 3-nitro-1-propionate or 3-nitro-1-propanol when the compounds were incubated together (Anderson et al., 1997; Zhang et al., 2014). This suggests that the reduction of nitrate may be energetically more favorable than the reduction of the nitrocompounds although the contribution of other mechanisms, such as the presence of more active nitrate-reducing enzymes cannot be excluded.

The two different mechanisms of action of these nitroalkanes, primarily direct inhibition of methanogenesis and secondarily acting as an alternative electron acceptor, are not necessarily incompatible as the process that directly inhibits methanogenesis may promote the redirection of electrons and thereby facilitate the reduction of the nitroalkanes. Subsequent in vitro studies have reported significant decreases in methane production by ruminal microbial populations treated with 4–13 μmol nitroethane/mL with modest affects on volatile fatty acid production and with recovery of electrons, expressed as hydrogen recoveries, accounting for 37–52% of the decrease in methane production (Gutierrez-Bañuelos et al., 2008; Bozic et al., 2009). The fate of the remaining hydrogen was undetermined but the authors speculated that other unmeasured sinks such as ethanol, formate or anabolic processes, such as those contributing to cell growth could be functional sinks (Gutierrez-Bañuelos et al., 2008; Bozic et al., 2009) as could reduced products of nitrocompound metabolism or the production of extracellular or intracellular polysaccharide production. Several other studies using a variety of other short chain nitrocompound have supported these findings, with only a few exceptions, the latter possibly resulting from a lesser or even an inability to dispose of electrons onto the nitrocompounds or attributable to differences in cultural conditions (Table ​(Table5).5). For instance, dimethyl-2-nitroglutarate and 2-nitro-methyl-propionate were found to effectively decrease ruminal methane production during an in vitro batch culture with ruminal microbes (Anderson et al., 2010). However, while it was anticipated that hydrolysis of the methyl esters and reduction of the nitrocompounds would yield methionine and alanine as potential endproducts of use to the host, no such evidence was obtained (Anderson et al., 2010). The microbial population had no prior exposure to these nitrocompounds; therefore it would be worthwhile to determine if adapted populations may be able to metabolize the nitrocompounds (Anderson et al., 2010).
With respect to in vivo studies, doses of 24 and 72 mg nitroethane and 40 and 120 mg 2-nitro-1-propanol (per kg body weight−1 day−1) resulted in methane-reducing activity being 37–69% lower than that in untreated controls, with nitroethane being more potent than 2-nitro-1-propanol (Anderson et al., 2006a). Methane-producing activity was measured via in vitro incubation of freshly collected rumen contents with excess methanogenic substrate concentrations and thus conceptually represents an indirect measure of numbers of methanogens, assuming their numbers are correlated with quantities of methane-producing enzymes. When administered to cattle at doses of 30–120 mg nitroethane kg body weight−1 day−1, methane-producing activity was decreased by 6 to as much as 44% when compared to controls, although methane production in vivo, measured using the sulfur hexafluoride technique, were decreased by no more than 22% (Gutierrez-Bañuelos et al., 2007; Brown et al., 2011). Oral administration of 2-nitro-1-propanol decreased ruminal acetate concentrations from that of controls by about 15% and the high nitroethane dose (120 mg kg body weight−1 day−1) decreased rumen acetate concentrations by about 24% in the fed steers of the study of Gutierrez-Bañuelos et al. (2007). When measured, rates of ruminal nitroethane-metabolizing activity were increased more than 30% but these increases were not always significant (Gutierrez-Bañuelos et al., 2007; Brown et al., 2011) thus suggesting that onset and duration of enrichment of competent nitroethane-metabolizing bacteria is highly variable between animals and possibly reflects de-enrichment in steers fed the lower doses due to depletion of ruminal nitroethane concentrations. Similarly, there was evidence of ruminal adaptation of the ruminal population to the lower but not the higher nitroethane dose, with methane-producing activity approaching control levels by 7 days of treatment in steers fed 80 mg nitroethane kg body weight−1 (Gutierrez-Bañuelos et al., 2007). This too possibly reflects a depletion of efficacious concentrations of nitroethane in rumen contents of low-dosed steers due to consumption by nitroethane-metabolizing bacteria. In the steers fed 120 mg nitroethane kg body weight−1 day−1, for instance, decreases in methane-producing activity persisted to the end of the 15 day administration. Thus, it is likely the higher dose not only allowed consumption of more reductant than the lower dose but also retained sufficient residual nitroethane concentration to maintain inhibitory pressure on methanogens and sustain growth of the nitroethane-metabolizing bacteria.

More recently, other researchers have observed 75–95% decreases in methane production during in vitro incubation of mixed populations of ruminal microbes treated with 0.05–0.66 μmol/mL ethyl-3-nitrooxy propionate or 3-nitrooxypropanol that suggests a greater potency of these more oxidized nitrocompounds (Martínez-Fernández et al., 2014; Romero-Pérez et al., 2015a). In the Rusitec study of Romero-Pérez et al. (2015a), hydrogen recovery in volatile fatty acid products was increased approximately 13–14% due to 3-nitrooxypropanol treatment and hydrogen accumulations were increased more than 3-fold yet recovery of all of the reductant spared from methanogenesis was not achieved. These authors also speculated that formate could possibly be an unmeasured hydrogen sink, but the potential metabolism of the nitroxy compounds to reduced products has not been discussed. A number of studies have examined the effect of 3-nitrooxypropanol on ruminal methane emissions from dairy or beef cattle and results have yielded positive results, with methane emissions, based on dry matter intake, being decreased from controls by 6 to nearly 60% (Haisan et al., 2014; Reynolds et al., 2014; Romero-Perez et al., 2014, 2015b; Hristov et al., 2015). Negative effects on animal performance, if observed, were modest. Variability in efficacy between studies possibly reflects differences in administration protocols (intraruminal vs. in feed) and methane measurement techniques. In the study of Hristov et al. (2015), as much as a 64-fold increase in hydrogen emissions was observed in 3-nitrooxypropanol-treated cattle, which was still only about 3% of the hydrogen spared from methanogenesis.

Few studies, as of yet, have determined the microbial response to nitrocompounds. At approximately 4 mM concentration, the naturally occurring nitrocompounds, 3-nitro-1-propionate and 3-nitro-1-propanol, were found to be modestly inhibitory to total culturable anaerobes from the bovine rumen, but the inhibited populations were not characterized (Anderson et al., 1993). These compounds as well as nitroethane, nitroethanol and 2-nitro-1-propanol are also inhibitory to uric acid degrading bacteria of poultry origin (Kim et al., 2005, 2009). Additionally, nitrocompounds, similarly to nitrates, inhibit the growth of many foodborne pathogens including Listeria, Salmonella, and Campylobacter and enteropathogenic E. coli (Jung et al., 2003, 2004a,b; Anderson et al., 2006b; Dimitrijevic et al., 2006), a use that has been patented (Anderson et al., 2007).
There is a significant amount of variation between animals with regard to their response to nitrate addition. Part of this response is due to the rumen ecosystem. The largest influencer would be the endogenous microbial populations and their enzymatic capacity. However, there are many other factors that influence the rate of reduction of nitrate, nitrite, and nitrocompounds.

First, the availability and amount of substrate supplying electrons used for the reductive nitrate reactions including carbohydrates, ethanol, mannitol, glycine, malate, citrate, lactate, succinate, pyruvate and formate (Lewis, 1950, 1951; Jones, 1972). Fatty acids, acetic, propionic, and butyric are not electron donors for nitrate reduction under this metabolic process. Thus, supplementing or provision of diets rich with these electron donors can potentially enhance nitrate reduction to ammonia, thereby further enhancing the decrease in methane and reducing the chances of nitrate poisoning as the animal will be exposed to less of the toxic intermediate nitrite which converts hemoglobin to methemoglobin also known as methemoglobinemia (Takahashi et al., 1980).

Dietary interventions such as high starch and cereal grains have been proposed to help mitigate nitrate toxicity (Burrows et al., 1987; Hibberd et al., 1994) purportedly by stimulating the metabolism of ruminal microorganisms thereby promoting production and subsequent availability of electron-donating substrates for nitrate and nitrite metabolism (Lewis, 1950, 1951; Allison and Reddy, 1984). High starch diets, within a pH range of about 6.6–6.8, have been shown to increase hydrogen production by mixed populations of ruminal microbes in vitro (Lin et al., 2013b). However, high starch diets are also well established to decrease rumen pH, which could potentially create an environment inhibitory to ruminal nitrate and nitrite metabolism. While enzymatic analysis indicates nitrate and nitrite reductases work optimally at pH of 6.5 or 5.6, respectively (Lewis, 1951; Tillman et al., 1965), nitrate- and nitrite-reducing activity within mixed populations of ruminal microbes was more rapid at neutral pH than at pH 6.0 or lower (Iwamoto et al., 2001). The inhibitory activity of the lower pH on nitrate- and nitrite-reducing activity within mixed rumen populations was attributed to lower availability of electron-donating substrates such as hydrogen, formate, or lactate resulting from an inhibition of fermentation caused by the low pH (Iwamoto et al., 2001). This would suggest that nitrate supplemented to concentrate fed-cattle may be ineffective or at least less effective in decreasing ruminal methane emissions than when supplemented to forage fed cattle. From a methane mitigation perspective, this may be of little consequence as the low ruminal pH in high concentrate-fed ruminants also inhibits methane production (Van Kessel and Russell, 1996; Lana et al., 1998; Russell, 1998) and thus concentrate-fed ruminants emit significantly less methane than do forage-fed cattle (Johnson and Johnson, 1995). From a toxicity perspective, however, it seems likely that supplementing nitrate to animals expected to have low rumen pH may increase risk for nitrite accumulation and subsequent toxicosis due to methemoglobinemia.

The next consideration is adaptation of the rumen microbial population to high nitrate diets. As has been alluded to earlier, the ruminal microbial population can be selected for increased nitrate- and nitrite-reducing activity by gradual feeding of increasing amounts of nitrate. However, little is known as to what might happen to the microbial population if an animal is de-adapted and selective pressure is removed. For instance, it is reasonable to suspect that should an animal go off feed and refuse its meals for a certain period of time a disbalance between rates of nitrate reduction and nitrite reduction may occur, which if favoring high nitrite accumulation may place the animal at greater risk to nitrite intoxication. Establishing or dosing the animal with a population of probiotic bacteria capable of reducing nitrite to non-toxic forms may also reduce the concentration of nitrite in the rumen. Currently, there is one patent, which is sold as a direct-fed microbial additive for the prevention of nitrite toxicity in ruminants fed nitrate. It employs a denitrifying strain of P. acidipropionici; however, its nitrate and especially its nitrite reductive capacity have not been proven to remediate nitrate toxicity nor enhance methane reduction (de Raphélis-Soissan et al., 2014). There is also a genetically modified E. coli strain that has been developed with enhanced nitrite utilization that has been proven to work in vitro and in vivo (Sar et al., 2005, 2006). However, its status as a GMO and as a strain of a pathogenic genus may create a barrier too large for its usage in production.

Adaptation can occur at the animal, or systemic, level as well. Ruminants increase the amount of hemoglobin, red blood cells, and blood volume, thereby increasing the capacity to deliver oxygen and counter the effect of increasing methemoglobin. This process occurs over months (Jainudeen et al., 1964). In addition, NADPH reductase will convert methemoglobin back to hemoglobin (Hibberd et al., 1994). It is reasonable to hypothesize that animals adapted to nitrate have an elevated concentration of NADH reductase, but this has not been documented.

The rate of nitrate reduction also appears to be influenced by sulfur availability and concentrations. The reduction of sulfate to sulphite and then sulfide is less energetically favorable than nitrate to nitrite to ammonia. Opportunistically the enzymes for each reaction generally work for both reductive processes due to the molecule's similarity in structure and charge (Thauer et al., 1977). In addition, sulfur stimulates the growth of sulfide-reducing bacteria. Therefore, the addition of sulfur should hypothetically increase the amount of nitrate and nitrite reduced and the speed of the reaction (Leng, 2008). Experimentally, L-cysteine, which is rich in sulfur, in conjunction with nitrate has been shown to suppress the formation of methemoglobin (Takahashi et al., 1998).

Less is known regarding factors affecting nitrocompound metabolism within the rumen, although protein supplementation enhances in vivo rates of ruminal 3-nitro-1-propanol metabolism in cattle (Majak, 1992) and the reducing substrates, hydrogen gas and formate, are known to be stimulatory to reduction of the nitrocompounds in vitro (Anderson et al., 1993). Moreover, supplementing ruminal populations with ferrous and sulfide ions markedly increased rates of 3-nitro-1-propionic acid and 3-nitro-1-propanol metabolism (Anderson et al., 1993), but had little if any effect on the metabolism of these nitrocompounds in populations of equine cecal microbes (Zhang et al., 2014). Mechanistically, the ferrous and sulfide ion additions were thought to promote ferredoxin-hydrogenase mediated electron transfer reactions contributing to the reduction of the nitrocompounds.
Nitrate and nitrite reduction to ammonia in the rumen is a more thermodynamically favorable reaction than the formation of methane with carbon dioxide as an electron acceptor. The effectiveness and risks of toxicity of this strategy are dependent on the nitrate salt type with sodium nitrate being the most biologically available and calcium the least in the rumen environment. A portion, albeit small, of the introducted nitrate appears to be metabolized to nitrous oxide either via dissimilatory nitrate reduction or more likely via incomplete denitrification, which may lessen its net greenhouse gas mitigation. A variety of certain short chain nitrocompounds as well as some nitro-oxy compounds have also been shown to decrease ruminal methane production. The naturally occurring nitrocompound, 3-nitro-1-propionate, is known to be metabolized by ruminal microbes to β-alanine, a non-essential amino acid that may be metabolized by the host and potentially used as a source of carbon, nitrogen and energy making it an attractive candidate. Safe and successful feeding of supplemental nitrate and nitrocompounds requires careful adaptation of the ruminal microbes to prevent risks of toxic intermediates and this practice could benefit via concurrent feeding of appropriate nitrite-reducing or nitrocompound degrading probiotic bacteria. Additionally, combination feeding of 3-nitro-1-propionate, or another appropriate nitrocompound, with subtoxic amounts of nitrate may yield synergistic advantages in inhibition of rumen methanogensis and electron capture in non-methane products.

More research is needed, however, on the pathways involved in nitrate and nitrocompound metabolism, the organisms involved, and the regulation of their enzyme activities in order to mitigate concerns that persist over the risks of toxicities and realize the full potential of these methane-decreasing strategies.

First-line schizontocidal treatment for uncomplicated malaria in the Republic of the Sudan is artesunate (total dose 12 mg/kg) plus Sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine (25/1.25 mg/kg) (AS/SP). Patients with Plasmodium vivax are also treated with 14 days primaquine (total dose 3.5 mg/kg) (PQ). The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of the national policy.
Patients above 1 year, with microscopy-confirmed, Plasmodium falciparum and/or P. vivax malaria were treated with AS/SP. Patients with P. falciparum were randomized to no primaquine (Pf-noPQ) or a single 0.25 mg/kg dose of PQ (Pf-PQ1). Patients with P. vivax received 14 days unsupervised 3.5 mg/kg PQ (Pv-PQ14) on day 2 or at the end of follow up (Pv-noPQ). Primary endpoint was the risk of recurrent parasitaemia at day 42. G6PD activity was measured by spectrophotometry and the Accessbio Biosensor™.
231 patients with P. falciparum (74.8%), 77 (24.9%) with P. vivax and 1 (0.3%) patient with mixed infection were enrolled. The PCR corrected cumulative risk of recurrent parasitaemia on day 42 was 3.8% (95% CI 1.2–11.2%) in the Pf-noPQ arm compared to 0.9% (95% CI 0.1–6.0%) in the Pf-PQ1 arm; (HR = 0.25 [95% CI 0.03–2.38], p = 0.189). The corresponding risks of recurrence were 13.4% (95% CI 5.2–31.9%) in the Pv-noPQ arm and 5.3% (95% CI 1.3–19.4%) in the Pv-PQ14 arm (HR 0.36 [95% CI 0.1–2.0], p = 0.212). Two (0.9%) patients had G6PD enzyme activity below 10%, 19 (8.9%) patients below 60% of the adjusted male median. Correlation between spectrophotometry and Biosensor™ was low (rs = 0.330, p < 0.001).
AS/SP remains effective for the treatment of P. falciparum and P. vivax. The addition of PQ reduced the risk of recurrent P. falciparum and P. vivax by day 42, although this did not reach statistical significance. The version of the Biosensor™ assessed is not suitable for routine use.

There has been a decline in the incidence of malaria in many sub-Saharan countries in the last decade [1–3], which has been attributed to the introduction of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), the scaling up of the distribution of insecticide-impregnated bed nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) [4]. There has also been an unprecedented increase in the funding of malaria control activities including intensive case management.

In Sudan, the number of malaria cases has declined, although the exact reduction in the burden of disease remains unclear. Information from local studies and reports suggest that in 2002 there were an estimated 9 million clinical cases of malaria and 44,000 deaths [5]. The WHO estimates are lower but highlight a substantial decline between 2000 and 2015, cases falling from 4 million cases in 2000–586,827 cases in 2015, with a total of 868 deaths [4]. However these successes have been associated with an increase in the proportion of infections due to Plasmodium vivax [6]. This rise likely reflects malaria control activities mostly targeting Plasmodium falciparum [7], and possibly an increased importation of vivax cases from neighbouring countries [6, 8, 9].

Since 2004, the first-line schizontocidal treatment for uncomplicated malaria in the Republic of Sudan has been artesunate plus Sulphadoxine–pyrimethamine (AS/SP) for both P. falciparum and P. vivax infections [10, 11] (Additional file 1, p. 12–34). In addition primaquine (PQ) is prescribed as a 14 day regimen for the radical cure of P. vivax hypnozoites following World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines (total dose 3.5, 0.25 mg/kg daily) [12, 13]; a single dose PQ is not currently recommended for patients with P. falciparum as gametocytocidal [14].

Whilst PQ is generally well tolerated, it can cause severe haemolysis in individuals with glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PDd) [15]. The WHO recommends that where feasible all patients should be tested for G6PD deficiency prior to prescribing primaquine based radical cure, however in view of the lack of available point of care tests to determine G6PDd status, this is not stipulated in the Sudanese anti-malarial treatment policy.

The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of AS/SP in patients with P. falciparum or P. vivax infection and the additional benefit of PQ either as a single dose for P. falciparum or 14-day regimen for P. vivax. The Biosensor™ (Accessbio, USA), a novel quantitative point of care G6PD diagnostic was also evaluated.
The study was conducted at two sites in the Republic of Sudan: Gezira Slanj, a semi-urban area north of Khartoum (15°53′11.2″N 32°31′39.9″E), and New Halfa, in the east of the country (15°20′N 35°35′00″E). Malaria transmission in north Khartoum and eastern Sudan is seasonal with the main transmission occurring between September to February [16, 17], although malaria occurs throughout the year at both study sites. Key mosquito vectors in Sudan include Anopheles arabiensis, besides Anopheles gambiae s.l. and Anopheles funestus s.l. [11].
Study participants were recruited from patients presenting to one of two health care facilities with febrile illness. Patients with peripheral P. falciparum and/or P. vivax parasitaemia detected by microscopy, aged at least 12 months, with history of fever in the last 24 h or axillary body temperature ≥ 37.5 °C were eligible for enrolment. Patients were excluded if they weighed less than 5 kg, were pregnant, had signs of severe malaria [18], were unable to tolerate oral medication, had a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration less than 8 g/dl, were on regular medication which could interfere with study treatment, or had known allergies to any of the study drugs. Whenever G6PD activity was determined by spectrophotometry participants with G6PD activities below 3.0 U/gHb were excluded from 14 day primaquine treatment [19].
The study was designed as an open label, prospective randomized, controlled trial with 42 days of follow up. All patients were treated with AS/SP, allocation to PQ treatment was randomized according to the species of infection. Patients with P. falciparum mono-infection were randomized to receive AS/SP either alone (Pf-noPQ) or with a single dose of PQ (Pf-PQ1) administered on day 2. Patients with a P. vivax mono or mixed infection were randomized to receive AS/SP either alone (Pv-noPQ) or combined with 14 days of PQ (Pv-PQ14) starting on day 2. Patients in the Pv-noPQ arm received PQ according to national guidelines but delayed until after the end of 42 day follow up.

Treatment allocation was randomized in blocks of 20 and was provided in a sealed opaque envelope, which was only opened by a study nurse once the participant had met all the enrolment criteria and had provided written informed consent. Study staff assigned the patients sequentially according to the sealed envelopes. Blinding of clinical staff towards group allocation was not possible with the standard commercially sourced drugs; however, assignment was concealed from the microscopists responsible for determination of the primary endpoint.
Quality assured co-formulated blister packs of AS/SP (Shanghai-Sudan Pharmaceutical Ltd, China) were used for the study and patients were treated for 3 days according to national guidelines (target dose 4 mg/kg/day for AS and 25/1.25 mg/kg for SP) [13, 14]. On day 2, patients with P. falciparum infection were allocated to receive either no further treatment (Pf-noPQ) or a single dose of 0.25 mg/kg PQ (Pf-PQ1), manufactured by ipca Laboratories Ltd, Mumbai India.

Patients infected with P. vivax alone or mixed with P. falciparum, were allocated either to AS/SP and 14 days of unsupervised PQ (0.25 mg/kg/day, total dose 3.5 mg/kg) starting on day 2 (Pv-PQ14) or AS/SP alone (Pv-noPQ).

All doses of AS/SP and the single dose PQ in the Pf-PQ1 arm were supervised, however only the first dose of primaquine in the Pv-PQ14 arm was supervised. Study participants were observed for 30 min after administration and those vomiting their dose were treated again with the same dose and observed for a further 30 min.

Patients with recurrent uncomplicated malaria during the follow up period were treated with artemether–lumefantrine (AL) and patients with severe malaria were treated with quinine according to national guidelines [14].
At enrolment demographic data, symptom details and history of anti-malarial medication were collected in a standardized questionnaire. A clinical examination was carried out and up to 5 ml venous blood taken for blood film examination, measurement of haemoglobin concentration (Hb), analysis of G6PD enzyme activity and parasite genotyping. Haemoglobin was measured at the bedside using at Hemocue 201 (Hemocue, Sweden) and G6PD activity measured with an experimental Biosensor™ (Accessbio, USA) following procedures as recommended by the manufacturer and described elsewhere [20, 21].

Patients were examined daily for the first 3 days and thereafter weekly on days 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42. Patients with P. vivax were seen on day 16 rather than day 14, at which time a pill count was undertaken. Patients were encouraged to return to the clinic whenever they experienced signs and symptoms consistent with malaria. At each follow up visit, a full physical examination was undertaken, a symptom questionnaire completed, adverse events assessed and capillary blood collected for repeat blood film examination and Hb measurement. Whenever possible patients who did not return for scheduled follow up visits were contacted and encouraged to return.
Thick and thin films were stained with Giemsa and counted per 200 white blood cells (WBC) or 1000 red blood cells (RBC). Presence and density of gametocytes were also assessed per 200WBC. Slides for microscopy were subject to internal and external quality control checks. 20% of all slides were read twice by two local microscopists, and in case of discordant results reread by a third microscopist (internal QC). All slides collected on enrolment and at the time of recurrent parasitaemia were subject to external quality control by a WHO-certified expert microscopist of the Malaria Research Facility of the Papuan Health and Community Development Foundation (PHCDF) in Timika, Papua Province, Indonesia (external QC).
Due to logistical reasons G6PD activity was only measured at one of the two sites. In New Halfa G6PD activity was measured directly upon sample collection using a handheld Biosensor (AccessBio CareStart, USA) and within 24 h by spectrophotometry (SPINREACT™, Spain) on a Mindray BA-88A (Minddray, China). G6PD normal and deficient controls (Ref: 100 252 0, SPINREACT, Spain), were run daily prior to sample measurement. Patients with P. vivax infection and G6PD activity below 3.0 U/gHb (based on spectrophotometry) were excluded from PQ treatment [19].
DNA was extracted from whole blood with a QIAamp DNA blood macro kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s recommendations. Extracted DNA was eluted in 50 μl water and used for the genotyping of recurrent P. falciparum infections following WHO recommendations [22] by characterizing the length polymorphism of the msp1, msp2, and glurp genes in samples collected at day 0 and on the day recurrent parasitaemia was found.

Recrudescence was determined when, for each marker (msp1, msp2, and glurp), at least one identical-length polymorphism was found between samples collected on day 0 and on the day of recurrent infection. A new infection was defined when, for at least one marker, the length polymorphisms were different between the sample collected on day 0 and that collected on the day of recurrent infection. Samples were defined as indeterminate when no marker could be amplified.
The primary endpoint of the study was the rate of recurrence of peripheral asexual parasitaemia within 42 days of follow up. Secondary endpoints were the proportion of patients with parasitaemia or fever on days 1, 2 and 3 and gametocyte carriage following P. falciparum malaria. Response to treatment was defined according to WHO definitions [23] and treatment failures were categorized as early treatment failures (ETF), late parasitological (LPTF) and late clinical treatment failures (LCTF). Patients without asexual parasitaemia by day 42, and who did not previously meet any of the criteria of ETF, LPTF or LCTF were defined as adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR). Fever clearance time (FCT) in patients with a temperature ≥ 37.5 °C at enrolment was defined as the time from drug administration until body temperature (axillary) was below 37.5 °C.
Assuming that AS/SP has a 15% risk of treatment failure at day 42 [24], and that this is unaffected by the addition of a single dose of primaquine, a total of 235 patients with P. falciparum infection determine the efficacy of AS/SP within ± 5% allowing for a loss to follow up rate of 10%. To achieve 80% power, 95% significance level to detect a decrease in P. vivax recurrence from 30 to 5%, following AS/SP plus or minus 14 days of primaquine (26), a sample size of 40 patients would be needed in each treatment arm.

Data were entered using EpiData (version 3.1,EpiData Software, Denmark) and analysed using Stata version 14 (Stata Corp., USA). The primary analysis was an intention to treat (ITT) analyses including all participants enrolled into the study. A secondary analysis was done using a modified intention to treat (mITT) approach in which patients who had received sub-optimal treatment dosage were excluded. Sub-optimal drug dosage was defined as a total dose below 4 mg/kg for AS, below 25 mg/kg for Sulphadoxine and 1.25 mg/kg for pyrimethamine [13, 14]. The sub-optimal PQ dose was defined as below 0.15 mg/kg in the Pf-PQ1 arm and below 2.5 mg/kg total dose of primaquine in the Pv-PQ14 arm [25].

Normally distributed data were compared using Student’s t-test, the t-test for paired samples or one-way analysis of variance, and non-parametric comparisons were made using the Mann–Whitney U test or Wilcoxon signed rank test for paired samples. Proportions were examined using χ2 with Yates’ correction or Fisher’s exact test. Correlations were assessed using the Pearson test for correlated proportions for normal distributed variables and the Spearman rank test for non-normal distributed variables. Efficacy endpoints were assessed by survival analysis, in which the cumulative risk of failure was calculated by the Kaplan–Meier product limit formula [26]. The equality of survivor functions was tested using the log-rank test (exponential scores test).

The results of the survival analysis were adjusted according to parasite genotyping results of the admission and recurrent parasitaemia. Patients with recurrent parasitaemia due to a different species identified on admission or a PCR confirmed re-infection were censored at the day of occurrence. Following a conservative approach indeterminate PCR results were considered treatment failures. Parasite clearance was presented as the proportion of patients with microscopy negative results within the first 3 days, missing data were treated as suggested by the World Wide Antimalarial Resistance Network (WWARN) [27].

Safety analysis included the risks of a drop in Hb concentration greater than 25%, severe anaemia (Hb < 7 g/dl), requiring a blood transfusion, and the proportion of patients with adverse and serious adverse events. Haematological response was assessed from the fractional fall in Hb between baseline and days 2, 7 and 16. The effect of malaria species, peripheral parasitaemia, G6PD activity and total dose of primaquine on the degree of haemolysis was assessed by multivariable linear regression using a backward selection of variables [28]. The performance of the Biosensor was assessed using standard formulae [29, 30] in which the adjusted male median (AMM) was considered 100% G6PD activity [15].
Between 7th December 2015 and 9th March 2016, 4887 patients were screened for malaria. Overall 486 (9.9%) patients had malaria, of whom 309 (63.6%) were enrolled in the study (213 [69.9%] in New Halfa and 96 [31.1%] in Gezira Slanj) (Fig. 1). The main reason for non-enrolment of patients with malaria, was declining to participate in the study (113/177, 63.8%). Other reasons are listed in Fig. 1. No patient was excluded from 14 day primaquine treatment because of low G6PD activity as measured by spectrophotometry.

Based on microscopy a total of 231 (74.8%) patients were infected with P. falciparum, 77 (24.9%) with P. vivax and one patient (0.3%) with a mixed infection of P. falciparum and P. vivax. Patients with P. falciparum infections had a significantly higher parasitaemia and were less likely to be gametocytaemic at enrolment than those with P. vivax infection (Table 1). Baseline characteristics between the randomized groups for each species were similar, proportions of patient enrolled into each arm were similar per site (Table 1).
The target dose of AS was achieved in 100.0% patients, but only 59.5% (184/309) of patients received the target dose of S/P (Table 2). The median dose of PQ prescribed for patients in the Pf-PQ1 arm was 0.25 mg/kg (IQR 0.192–0.333) with 5 patients (4.2%) receiving less than 0.15 mg/kg. The median total dose of PQ prescribed in the Pv-PQ14 arm was 4.20 mg/kg (IQR 3.18–4.67), with 15.4% (6/39) patients prescribed a total dose less than 2.5 mg/kg [26]. Pill counts were undertaken in all patients receiving 14 days unsupervised PQ (Pv-PQ14) at the end of their treatment course. One participant (2.6%) had only taken 2 of the 14 doses of PQ, but no pills were remaining for any of the other patients.
Of the 231 patients with P. falciparum infection, 74.7% (130/174) were still parasitaemic on day 1, and this fell to 4.6% (8/174) on day 2. One 10-year old patient with a baseline parasitaemia of 2750 parasites/µl was afebrile, but still parasitaemic (475 µl−1) on day 3; he was subsequently lost to follow up. Fever clearance in all other patients with P. falciparum infection was rapid, with 95.4% (124/130) patients being afebrile by day 2.

Parasite clearance in patients with P. vivax was slower than that for P. falciparum. Of the 78 patients with P. vivax or mixed infection, 96.8% (60/62) were still parasitaemic on day 1 and 17.7% (11/62) on day 2. One 35-year old patient (1.6%) with a baseline parasitaemia of 9300 parasites/µl was afebrile, but remained parasitaemic (645 µl−1) on day 3; the patient was subsequently lost to follow up. All patients with P. vivax parasitaemia had gametocytes present at baseline, but by day 2 this proportion had fallen to 1.6% (1/62). Fever clearance was fast with only one patient with P. vivax being febrile by day 2.
A total of 85 (27.5%) patients were lost to follow up before the end of the study and one patient (0.32%) presented with P. falciparum infection on day 28 after being enrolled with a P. vivax infection (Fig. 1). There were no early treatment failures in any treatment arm, but 11 (3.6%) patients represented with late treatment failure (LTF), 7 of which were classified as LPTF and 4 as LCTF (Fig. 1).

Plasmodium falciparum arms
In the P. falciparum arm, a total of 5 patients had recurrent parasitaemia on days 7 (n = 2), 14 (n = 2) and 35 (n = 1). The overall risk of recurrent parasitemia on day 28 was 2.0% [95% CI 0.75–5.19%], the risk being greater in patients treated with Pf-noPQ (3.4% [95% CI 1.1–10.3%]) compared to 0.9% (95% CI 0.1–6.0%) in those treated with Pf-PQ1; Hazard Ratio HR = 0.26 [95% CI 0.03–2.47], p = 0.203.

By day 42 the risk of parasite recurrence was 2.5% [95% CI 2.06–6.01%]; 4.8% (95% CI 1.8–12.4%) in the Pf-noPQ and 0.9% (95% CI 0.1–6.0%) in the Pf-PQ14 (HR = 0.19 [95 CI 0.02–1.67], p = 0.092); Fig. 2. PCR demonstrated one patient with a reinfection in the Pf-noPQ arm, with the 4 other recurrent samples of the Pf-PQ1 arm providing indeterminate results. The PCR adjusted risk of failure on day 28 was 2.4% (95% CI 0.6–0.9%) and 3.8% (1.2–11.2%) on day 42 (HR = 0.25 [95 CI 0.03–2.38], p = 0.188) for the Pf-noPQ arm. Site specific efficacy estimates are summarized in Table 3, efficacy between sites for the individual arms did not vary significantly (all p > 0.05). No patients initially infected with P. falciparum had gametocytes detected on blood film examination during follow up.
In the P. vivax arms, a total of 6 patients had recurrent parasitaemia at days 14 (n = 1), 21 (n = 1), 28 (n = 1), 35 (n = 3). In patients not receiving 14 days primaquine the risk of recurrent P. vivax at day 28 was 9.9% [95% CI 3.3–27.8%] compared to 0% in those treated with AS/SP plus 14 days primaquine; p = 0.046. At day 42 the respective risks had risen to 13.4% [95% CI 5.2–31.9%] in the Pv-noPQ arm and 5.3% [95% CI 1.3–19.4%] in the Pv-PQ14 arm; HR 0.36, [95% CI 0.1–2.0], p = 0.212 (Fig. 2). There was no difference in treatment efficacy between sites (Table 3).
In the mITT analysis, 41.7% (129/309) of patients receiving a sub-optimal dose of any of the study drugs were excluded, leaving 127 (54.9%) of patients with P. falciparum and 53 (67.9%) patients with P. vivax (Table 3). The overall risk of recurrent parasitaemia was lower in patients who had received optimal treatment, although this did not reach statistical significance in any arm by day 42.

No patient received sub-optimal AS (Table 2). For patients of the Pv-noPQ arm who received less than 25 mg/kg SP, the risk of recurrence was 39.4% [95% CI 16.90–74.20] compared to 0.0% in patients of the same arm who received higher treatment doses (p = 0.003). No significant differences in efficacy were found when comparing sub-optimal versus optimal SP treatment in the other treatment arms.
At baseline the median Hb concentration was 11.7 g/dl in patients with P. falciparum and 11.0 g/dl in patients with P. vivax (Table 1). The greatest median fractional fall in Hb occurred in the P. falciparum arms between baseline and day 2 prior to administration of any primaquine, whereas there was no median drop in Hb among patients with a P. vivax infection (Table 4). On day 2 patients infected with P. falciparum had a median fractional change in Hb of − 4.9% (IQR − 10.6 to + 0.9, range − 29.3 to + 50.7), compared to patients infected with P. vivax whose Hb did not change (IQR − 7.1 to + 7.7 to 4.6, range − 23.1 to + 50.0) over the same period; p = 0.015 (Fig. 3). A total of 1.7% (4/231) of patients with P. falciparum had a fractional fall in Hb greater than 25% between day of enrolment and day 2, while this was not the case for any patient with P. vivax infection (p = 0.316).

Fig. 3
Fractional change of Hb between baseline and day of follow up

The median Hb levels increased in all treatment arms between days 0 and 7 (Fig. 3, Table 4). In patients with P. falciparum the Hb concentration at day 7 had risen 6.0% (IQR − 0.8 to 14.8) from baseline following treatment with Pf-noPQ compared to 13.2% (IQR 0.0 to 23.9) after treatment with Pf-PQ1; p = 0.007. In patients with P. vivax, there was no change in Hb (IQR 0.0 to 10.0) between day 0 and day 7 following treatment with Pv-noPQ compared to 9.1% (IQR 0.0 to 15.4) in vivax patients treated with primaquine (Pv-PQ14); p = 0.106. None of the patients included required a blood transfusion.
A total of 551 adverse events (AE) were reported, of which 497 (90.2%) were categorized as mild and 51 (9.8%) as moderate. Three (0.5%) mild events were recorded as possibly related to AS/SP. The most frequent AEs were gastrointestinal symptoms including poor appetite (40.3%), nausea (25.6%) and abdominal pain (20.7%) (Table 5). In 93.8% (226/241) of cases the first episode of gastrointestinal symptoms was reported on or after day 2. In total 68.9% (82/119) of patients treated with Pf-PQ1 reported at least one gastrointestinal AE on or after day 2 compared to 81.3% (91/112) of those with Pf-noPQ; relative risk = 0.820 [95% CI 0.631–1.065], p = 0.155. The corresponding relative risk in patients from the Pv-PQ14 arm compared to patients from the Pv-noPQ arm was 0.943 [95% CI 0.592–1.50], p = 0.808. No serious adverse events occurred in any study patient.

G6PD activity and performance of the biosensor (AccessBio–CareStart)
G6PD activity was quantified by spectrophotometry and Biosensor™ in 68.5% (213/309) patients. The adjusted male median by spectrophotometry was 9.7 U/gHb, compared to 7.9 U/gHb derived by the Biosensor™ (p < 0.001). By spectrophotometry 2 (0.9%) patients with P. falciparum infection had G6PD activities less than 10% of the AMM, no patient had G6PD activities between 10 and 30% and 18 (8.5%) patients had G6PD activity between 30 and 60% (Fig. 4).

The Biosensor™ identified 1 patient with less than 10% G6PD activity, 11 participants (5.2%) with activities between 10 and 30% activity, and 27 patients with G6PD activity between 30 and 60% (Table 6, Fig. 5). None of the patients with G6PD activities below 10% were identified by the biosensor correctly. The correlation between the activity recorded by the two assays was rs = 0.330 (p < 0.001), with a mean difference of 2.1 U/gHb and the 95% limit of agreement (LoA) ranged from − 5.1 U/gHb to 9.2 U/gHb (Figs. 4, ​,5).5). In the absence of true G6PD deficient results with activities < 30% of the AMM sensitivity could not be calculated, while specificity was 0.94 (95% CI 0.90–0.97). Sensitivity and specificity at 60% of the AMM were 0.55 (95% CI 0.32–0.77) and 0.86 (95% CI 0.80–0.91), respectively.

This efficacy study demonstrates that when the target dose of AS/SP was achieved the risk of recurrent parasitaemia was low for patients with either P. falciparum or P. vivax in the two Sudanese study sites assessed. The dosage scheme applied followed recommendations of the WHO; never the less almost half of the patients received a dose of SP less than the intended target dose of 25 mg/kg [13]. While the target dose is designed for patients with a maximum body weight of 60 kg, a substantial fraction of the study population weighed more, resulting in under dosing (Additional file 1) and in patients with P. vivax treated with AS/SP alone, this was associated with an almost 40% risk of recurrence by day 42. The additional administration of single dose primaquine in patients with P. falciparum and 14 days primaquine in P. vivax, was associated with lower risks of parasite recurrence (5.3- and 2.8-fold, respectively), although these benefits did not reach statistical significance. Results on gametocyte carriage are limited by the small denominator applied for microscopy (200WBC).

In 2006, a study in the east of the country reported a day 28 PCR corrected efficacy of 93.5% for AS/SP for P. falciparum [31]. Other clinical studies conducted between 2010 and 2015 at six sites suggest that the PCR corrected efficacy of AS/SP against P. falciparum by day 28 generally exceeds 95%, except for one site in Gedaref, in the East of the country, where the efficacy fell from 91% in 2012 to 87% in 2015 [32].

One study from Kassala, Eastern Sudan reported a PCR corrected efficacy of 93.7% by day 28 [33], while a study from Damazin, South-Eastern Sudan reported a PCR corrected efficacy of 80% for AS/SP by day 28 [34]. The study in Kassala also identified a high proportion of parasites with double mutations in the pfdhfr and pfdhps genes and a single case with a triple mutation in the pfdhfr gene, all associated with antifolate resistance [33].

In Somalia, the efficacy of AS/SP has fallen to 88% and artemether–lumefantrine has replaced AS/SP as the first-line treatment for P. falciparum [35]. In March 2017, after patient enrolment to the current study had been completed, North Sudan anti-malarial policy was also changed from AS/SP to artemether–lumefantrine (AL) for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria.

In areas co-endemic for P. falciparum and P. vivax AS/SP has been used as a universal schizontocidal treatment for both species particularly in locations where diagnostic facilities are unable to distinguish reliably between species. To date 3 published trials have assessed the efficacy of AS/SP against P. vivax. Tjitra et al. found AS/SP to have almost 90% efficacy against P. vivax in Papua, Indonesia [36]. However clinical trials with longer follow up revealed that the risk of recurrent P. vivax by day 42 after AS/SP rose to 25% in Afghanistan [37], and 67% in Papua New Guinea [38]. In the current study, the overall risk of P. vivax recurrence at day 42 was 13.4% in patients treated with AS/SP alone, less than half that expected in our a priori power calculation. The risk of recurrence fell to 5.3% in those treated with AS/SP plus 14 days primaquine although this did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.212); Table 3. A longer follow-up and larger sample size would be required to document the additional benefits of primaquine radical cure that appeared to be emerging [39].

WHO guidelines recommend that the radical cure of P. vivax can be achieved with a 14-day regimen of primaquine, although the long course of treatment is associated with poor adherence and compromised effectiveness [25, 40–44]. In some settings unsupervised PQ appears to work well [45], and indeed in the current study pill counting, undertaken on day 16, suggested excellent adherence to the 14-day treatment regimen, with only one patient out of 39 failing to take all of their tablets. However, the nature of a clinical trial including regular review may influence patients behaviour significantly, leading to an overestimation of the true clinical effectiveness in non-trial settings.

PQ is known to cause haemolysis in G6PD deficient individuals with the nadir usually observed 2–7 days after initial exposure [46]. The greatest fall in Hb was observed at day 2 prior to the administration of any primaquine and thus is likely to be attributable to parasite rather than drug induced haemolysis. In patients with P. falciparum infection there was no further fall in Hb observed between day 2 and day 7, with or without a single dose of primaquine. These observations are reassuring and concur with previous reports from Tanzania [47] supporting the current WHO guidelines that do not recommend routine G6PD testing prior to the administration of a single dose of PQ [13]. None of the patients with P. vivax infection had G6PD activity below 30%, although 2/22 (9.1%) had intermediate activity between 30 and 60%, reassuringly none of the patients had a significant fall in Hb after day 2.

Howes et al. had earlier documented a country wide G6PD deficiency prevalence of 15.3% with higher frequencies towards the West of the country and lower frequencies in the East [48]. These prevalence estimates are based on 8 surveys and a definition of G6PD deficiency using a cut-off of 30% [15]. G6PD enzyme activity was only assessed in patients enrolled in New Halfa in the East of the country and defined following the same cut-off. Based on this definition only two patients (0.9%) were G6PD deficient. This lower prevalence is partly explained by the location of sample collection which was close to the borders with Eritrea and Ethiopia, where the prevalence of G6PD deficiency is low [48]. Furthermore, it is likely that G6PD deficiency offers some degree of protection against clinical malaria [49–54], and the patients with deficiency identified in cross sectional surveys may be less likely to present to clinics with symptomatic illness.

The study also evaluated a novel point of care Biosenor™ (Accessbio/Carestart, USA) which was compared to the reference method of spectrophotometry. The results highlight that the current Biosensor™ underdiagnosed severe G6PD deficiency, a finding consistent with a recent similar study conducted in Bangladesh [21]. Out of the 21 participants with G6PD activities below 60% by spectrophotometry only 11 (52.4%) were correctly classified with both patients with severe G6PDd classified as intermediate deficiency using the Biosensor™.
AS/SP appears to retain adequate efficacy in uncomplicated malaria in New Halfa and Gezira Slanj. Both a single dose of primaquine in patients with P. falciparum and a 14-day regimen in patients with P. vivax were well tolerated, and associated with a modest reduction in the number of recurrences by day 42, however reduction was not significant for P. falciparum. The Biosensor™ achieved suitable operational characteristics, but test performance is insufficient for routine diagnosis. A second generation with integrated haemoglobin measurement will be introduced to the market and may provide a more suitable solution.

Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are important for gene regulation and the maintenance of heterochromatin in eukaryotes. Schizosaccharomyces pombe was used as a model system to investigate the functional divergence within this conserved enzyme family. S. pombe has three HDACs encoded by the hda1+, clr3+, and clr6+ genes. Strains mutated in these genes have previously been shown to display strikingly different phenotypes when assayed for viability, chromosome loss, and silencing. Here, conserved differences in the substrate binding pocket identify Clr6 and Hda1 as class I HDACs, while Clr3 belongs in the class II family. Furthermore, these HDACs were shown to have strikingly different subcellular localization patterns. Hda1 was localized to the cytoplasm, while most of Clr3 resided throughout the nucleus. Finally, Clr6 was localized exclusively on the chromosomes in a spotted pattern. Interestingly, Clr3, the only HDAC present in the nucleolus, was required for ribosomal DNA (rDNA) silencing. Clr3 presumably acts directly on heterochromatin, since it colocalized with the centromere, mating-type region, and rDNA as visualized by in situ hybridization. In addition, Clr3 could be cross-linked to mat3 in chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments. Western analysis of bulk histone preparations indicated that Hda1 (class I) had a generally low level of activity in vivo and Clr6 (class I) had a high level of activity and broad in vivo substrate specificity, whereas Clr3 (class II) displayed its main activity on acetylated lysine 14 of histone H3. Thus, the distinct functions of the S. pombe HDACs are likely explained by their distinct cellular localization and their different in vivo specificities.

Heterochromatic regions of the chromosomes, such as the centromeres and telomeres, are specialized noncoding structures with important functions for genomic stability. Euchromatic regions, on the other hand, are the chromosomal domains in which a majority of the transcriptionally active genes are located. In general, heterochromatin contains underacetylated histone amino-terminal tails compared to euchromatin (22). The acetylation of histones is carried out by histone acetyl transferases (HATs) (5) at several conserved lysine residues of the N-terminal tails of histone H3 and H4. Important positions are K9 and K14 of histone H3 and K5, K8, K12, and K16 of histone H4. There are two protein families with histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity: the SIR2 family of NAD-dependent HDACs, the enzymatic activity of which was only recently discovered (20, 28), and the “classical” HDAC family. The “classical” HDAC family members fall into two different phylogenetic classes, namely class I and class II (14, 29). The HDAC enzyme was first purified by binding to trapoxin, an inhibitor that irreversibly bind to the active site of the enzyme (39). Subsequently, HDACs were shown to participate in large multiprotein complexes as corepressors requiring the HDAC enzymatic activity for repression of gene transcription (18, 19, 23, 27, 34). Generally HDAC enzymes work on acetylated histone substrates, but there are cases in which other proteins, such as p53, become deacetylated by HDAC1 (30). The structure of a sequence homologue of the HDAC family of proteins from the archaebacterium Aquifex aeolicus has been determined. It revealed that the conserved regions in HDACs form an active site with a Zn2+ atom in the center and, furthermore, that this site can be blocked by TSA (11).

The Schizosaccharomyces pombe putative HDACs are encoded by the hda1+, clr3+, and clr6+ genes (with clr for cryptic loci regulator) (13, 25, 36). The hda1+ gene was discovered due to its homology to RPD3 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, while clr3+ and clr6+ were identified in screens aimed at identifying mutants deficient in mating-type silencing in fission yeast. Hda1 has been shown to have an HDAC activity (25). Genetic analysis of the S. pombe HDACs indicates functional divergence of the three proteins. The clr6+ gene is essential, while hda1Δ cells are viable (13, 25). Strains with mutations in clr3+ or clr6+ are silencing deficient, while hda1Δ results in strengthened silencing (10, 13, 36, 41). In addition, clr6+ is necessary for genomic stability, since a conditional mutation in the gene results in chromosome loss (13). This phenotype is not displayed by mutations in clr3+ or hda1+ (1, 36). It is tempting to seek mechanistic explanations for the observed and sometimes counterintuitive phenotypic differences within this enzyme family by using a simple model system.

In this study, we have compared the properties of three HDACs in S. pombe. We have investigated the localization of the proteins in the cell and established their in vivo enzymatic activities. Their importance for silencing of polymerase II (Pol II) marker genes inserted into the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) was examined. A more profound investigation of one of the enzymes, Clr3, reveals a major activity in Western analysis of bulk histone preparations for lysine K14 of histone H3. Clr3 acts directly on the silent mating-type chromatin, since it colocalizes with mat2/3 and can be cross-linked to the mating-type region in chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments.
The characteristics of the S. pombe strains used in this study are listed in Table ​Table11 . Media were prepared according to reference 40. The hda1+, clr3+, and clr6+ genes were tagged at their endogenous locus, and the clr3+ gene was deleted by the method described in reference 2. Pom152-green fluorescent protein (GFP) was constructed according to reference 26. The resulting PCR products were integrated into the genome of the haploid strain FY367 or FY1180 or of the diploid strain Hu114. PCR and subsequent sequencing of the PCR products confirmed correct integration.
A ClustalW multiple alignment of HDACs was performed with Mac Vector 6.5 (Genetics Computer Group, Inc.) by using the “blosum” matrix and a gap penalty of 50.0. A total of 19 HDAC amino acid sequences were aligned. The resulting dendrogram showing the phylogenetic relationships is depicted in Fig. ​Fig.1A,1A, and the sequence alignment is presented in Fig. ​Fig.1B.1B. The following protein amino acid sequences (species and accession numbers follow in parentheses) were used: SpHda1 (S. pombe, AL021046), ScHOS2 (S. cerevisiae, X91837), SpClr6 (S. pombe, AFO64206), ScRPD3 (S. cerevisiae, P32561), hHDAC2 (Homo sapiens, NP_001518), hHDAC1 (H. sapiens, Q13547), DmHDAC1 (Drosophila melanogaster, AF026949), hHDAC3 (H. sapiens, AF039703), bACUC1 (A. aeolicus, D70388), ScHOS1 (S. cerevisiae, Z49219_23), SpClr3 (S. pombe, AFO64207), ScHDA1 (S. cerevisiae, Z71297), mHDA2 (Mus musculus, AF006603), hHDAC6 (H. sapiens, AF132609), mHDA1 (M. musculus, AF006602), hHDAC5 (H. sapiens, AF132608), hHDAC4 (H. sapiens, AF132607), bACUC2 (A. aeolicus, A70481), and ScHOS3 (S. cerevisiae, U43503).
Coimmunoprecipitations (co-IPs) were carried out according to reference 17. Lysis of log-phase cells with glass beads and subsequent co-IPs were performed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer or a nonionic general lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES-KOH [pH 7.5], 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail from Boehringer Mannheim). Preclearing and co-IP were conducted with protein A coupled to Sepharose beads. Immunoprecipitates were obtained with rabbit anti-myc (Research Laboratories), mouse antihemagglutinin (anti-HA) (Boehringer Mannheim), or rabbit anti-HA (Upstate) antibodies. The immunoprecipitated material was subjected to Western analysis (17).
S. pombe cells were prepared for immunofluorescence microscopy according to the formaldehyde fixation procedure with some modifications (16). Log-phase cultures were incubated for 5 to 30 min in yeast extract with supplements (YES) plus 1.2 M sorbitol before harvest. In most cases, PEMAL (PEM [100 mM PIPES, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgSO4, pH 6.9] plus 5% or 0.03% milk, 0.1 M l-lysine HCl, cleared by 30 min of centrifugation at 20,000 × g) was used instead of PEMBAL (PEM plus 1% bovine serum albumin [essential fatty acids and globulin-free sigma] and 100 mM lysine hydrochloride, pH 6.9). The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-myc, mouse anti-myc (Sigma), mouse anti-HA, mouse anti-GFP (Molecular Probes), and rabbit anti-Nop1 (21). Clr6 antibodies were raised in rabbits against the N-terminal peptide MGFGKKKVSYFYD and C-terminal peptide IAKEEFTIMDERV. The sera were affinity purified against the peptides, mixed 1:1, and used for immunostaining. Fluorescein isothiocyanate- or Texas red-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories or Sigma. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) experiments were carried out with the pRS314 probe to detect centromeres and the probe for rDNA loci according to reference 9. The c1555 probe was used to detect the entire mat2/3 region in S. pombe (33). Cells were visualized with a Zeiss Axioskop II microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu C4742-95 charge-coupled device camera. A z-series digital confocal deconvolution analysis with Openlab software, version 2:09 (Improvision), was performed with 0.2- to 0.3-μm sample z-series spacing and nearest-neighbor deconvolution. An object magnification of ×100 and a lens aperture of 1.4 were used.

Western analysis of bulk histones.
S. pombe strains were grown at 36°C overnight, and crude histones were prepared, separated, and Western blotted according to reference 8. Antibody incubation was performed according to manufacturer's (Upstate) instructions. Antibodies against histone H3 acetylated at position K9 or K14 or histone H4 acetylated at position K8 or K12 were purchased from Upstate. Antibodies against histone H4 acetylated at positions K5 and K16 were as described by reference 43 or purchased from Serotec. An antibody against the C-terminal part of histone H3 was used (A.Verreault, unpublished data). The band intensity was quantified with Fujifilm Image Gauge software. The signal was normalized to the loading control anti-histone H3 or Coomassie staining of the histones.

ChIPs.
Chromatin immunoprecipitations (ChIPs) were performed according to reference 9 with antibodies against histone H3 acetylated at position K9 or K14 or against histone H4 acetylated at position K8 or K12 (Upstate) or with mouse antibodies directed against the myc epitope (Sigma). The immunoprecipitated DNA was amplified and labeled with 5′-GAGGGGATGAAAAATCCCA-3′ and 5′-TTCGACAACAGGATTACGAC-3′ as ura4 primers in a PCR with [α-32P]dCTP. PCR products were separated on 4% polyacrylamide gels, detected with Fujifilm Phosphorimager FLA3000, and quantified with Fujifilm Image Gauge software.
Phylogenetic relationships between HDACs.
A database search of the S. pombe genome (www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/S_pombe/) was performed to investigate the total number of putative HDACs in the organism. The entire S. pombe genome (pompep) protein database including 4,952 protein sequences was BLAST-searched with hHDAC1. The search identified the three previously described HDAC homologues of S. pombe, Hda1, Clr3, and Clr6, and did not reveal any additional S. pombe members of this HDAC family. The three amino acid sequences were aligned together with HDAC proteins from other organisms, and a phylogenetic tree was constructed. As expected from previous studies (29), the resulting dendrogram of HDAC sequences formed two major groups, class I and class II (Fig. ​(Fig.1A).1A). It was clear that the two classes were older than the divergence into three kingdoms (Archae, Eubacteria, and Eukarya), since the two archaebacterial sequences from the same species (A. aeolicus) were present with one in each class (see bACUC1 and bACUC2). The S. pombe HDAC homologues also appeared in both phylogenetic classes. Hda1 and Clr6 belong together with RPD3 of S. cerevisiae and HDAC1, -2, and -3 from humans in class I, while Clr3 belonged to class II together with HDA1 from S. cerevisiae and HDAC4, -5, and -6 from humans. The sequence alignment (Fig. ​(Fig.1B)1B) revealed drastic conserved differences between the class I and class II enzymes. The differences were particularly clear in the L3, L4, L5, L6, and L7 loops and in the adjacent β4 region, which form a pocket domain where the active site has been determined to be, in the HDAC homologue bACUC1 from the archaebacterium A. aeolicus (11).

Distinct localization patterns of the S. pombe HDACs
In order to further investigate the three S. pombe HDACs, their gene products were epitope tagged at their respective loci under the control of their own endogenous promoters. Hda1 and Clr6 were tagged with the HA epitope, and Clr3 was tagged with the myc epitope. Western analysis of the epitope-tagged strains showed that the migration of the proteins corresponded to their predicted sizes: the class I proteins, Hda1 and Clr6, with smaller sizes of 48 and 45 kDa, respectively, and the larger class II protein, Clr3, of 76 kDa (data not shown).

The tagged strains were used to investigate the subcellular localization of the three S. pombe HDAC proteins by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. The immunofluorescence analysis clearly showed that Hda1-HA was a cytoplasmatic protein throughout the cell cycle (Fig. ​(Fig.2A)2A) (data not shown), while Clr3 and Clr6 localized to the nucleus. To facilitate a more detailed localization study of the nuclear proteins, the nuclear membrane was labeled by tagging the Pom152 protein with GFP. Pom152 is an S. pombe homologue of S. cerevisiae POM152, which is a previously described component of the nuclear pore complex (6, 44). Double immunofluorescence labeling and z-series digital confocal deconvolution analysis of Clr3-myc and Pom152-GFP revealed that Clr3-myc was predominantly nuclear with Clr3-myc foci occupying the entire nuclear space, including the 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)-stained chromosomes and the nucleolus (Fig. ​(Fig.2B).2B). The Clr3-myc signal was directly adjacent to and occasionally overlapping with the Pom152-GFP signal (Fig. ​(Fig.2B2B [Clr3-myc and Pom152-GFP merged]), indicating that Clr3-myc also occupied a region at the nuclear periphery. In addition, a subpopulation of Clr3-myc could be found in the cytoplasm of the cell (Fig. ​(Fig.2B;2B; see Fig. 4B). A similar analysis was carried out with Clr6-HA and revealed that Clr6-HA was localized in the nucleus with foci exclusively on the DAPI-stained chromosomes (Fig. ​(Fig.2C).2C). The deconvolution analysis revealed a Clr6-HA free space at the nuclear periphery close to the Pom152-GFP signal (Fig. ​(Fig.2C).2C). The chromosomal localization of the HA-tagged Clr6 protein was confirmed by raising antibodies against the Clr6 protein and using them in indirect immunofluorescence (Fig. ​(Fig.2D).2D). Staining of wild-type cells with the antibodies against Clr6 showed the same spotted localization pattern on the chromatin as the Clr6-HA strain did. As controls, an untagged wild-type strain was incubated with antibodies against the tags used. No signal was detected in these control experiments, indicating that the detected signals truly reflected the localization of the epitope-tagged proteins (data not shown).

FIG. 2.
Each of the HDACs in S. pombe has a distinct characteristic cellular localization pattern. Cells of the indicated strains were processed for immunofluorescence microscopy. (A) The strain Hu268 (hda1-HA) was stained with DAPI (red) and HA antibodies (green). Hda1-HA (green) is located primarily in the cytoplasm. (B) The strain Hu397 (clr3-myc pom152-GFP) was stained with anti-myc (red) and anti-GFP (green) antibodies and DAPI (blue). The Clr3-Myc pattern colocalizes with the DNA (blue), but is not restricted to the chromatin-containing regions of the nucleus. (C) The strain Hu401 (clr6-HA pom152-GFP) was stained with anti-HA (red) and anti-GFP (green) antibodies and DAPI (blue). The Clr6-HA (red) foci were restricted to the chromatin and thus excluded from the perinuclear region, surrounded by the Pom152-GFP counter stain. (D) The strain FY648 (wild type) was stained with anti-Clr6 antibodies and DAPI. (B, C, and D) The immunofluorescence microscopy images were deconvolved (z = 0.3 μm) and merged.

We also performed double immunofluorescence localization experiments and z-series digital confocal deconvolution analysis on a strain epitope tagged with both Clr3-myc and Clr6-HA. This three-dimensional analysis revealed little overlap between the Clr6 and Clr3 signals (Fig. ​(Fig.3).3). The localization data suggested that there was little or no physical interaction between the three S. pombe HDACs. To further test this possibility, strains carrying pairs of epitope-tagged S. pombe HDACs were subjected to co-IP experiments. If the HDACs were part of the same complexes, they would most likely be detected in reciprocal immunoprecipitates by using the myc and HA epitopes. None of the HDACs underwent co-IP with any of the other HDACs; instead they remained in the supernatants (data not shown). Taken together, these immunolocalization and co-IP experiments indicate that the S. pombe HDACs are not physically associated and, furthermore, they occupy different cellular compartments.

FIG. 3.
Clr6 and Clr3 nuclear foci do not coincide. The strain Hu067 (clr6-HA clr3-myc) was processed for immunofluorescence microscopy and stained with anti-HA (red) and anti-myc (green) antibodies and DAPI (blue). The spotted nuclear patterns of the Clr6-HA (red) and Clr3-Myc (green) rarely colocalized completely (yellow) after deconvolution (z = 0.3 μm).

Clr3 acts directly in mating-type silencing.
To further investigate the function of the clr3+ gene, a complete null allele was constructed. The resulting haploid clr3::kanMX6 (clr3Δ) cells were viable, showing that clr3+ is not an essential gene. To determine whether the clr3Δ null allele had the same effects on silencing as previously described for the clr3-E36 mutation (1), the clr3Δ marker was combined with a ura4+ reporter gene inserted into the different heterochromatic regions of S. pombe (centromere, telomere, and mating-type regions) (1). The strains were subjected to a silencing assay in which growth on plates with or without uracil and on plates containing the drug fluoroorotic acid (FOA), was compared. Strains whose sole functional copy of the ura4+ gene resides either in the centromere region, imrR(NcoI)::ura4+, or in the mating-type region, mat3-M::ura4+, grow poorly on medium lacking uracil and grow well on the FOA-containing plates due to the efficient repression of the ura4+ reporter gene at these locations (Fig. ​(Fig.4A4A and C, top row). In the clr3Δ genetic background, the imrR(NcoI)::ura4 marker gene was derepressed, so cells grew better on plates lacking uracil as compared to the wild type and could not form colonies on FOA (Fig. ​(Fig.4A,4A, third row). In the clr3Δ genetic background, the mat3-M::ura4+ marker gene was strongly derepressed, resulting in full growth on plates lacking uracil, and no growth on FOA-containing plates (Fig. ​(Fig.4C,4C, third row). Silencing of a telomeric marker gene was also investigated, and we found that the clr3Δ allele had a slight effect on telomeric silencing. All of these silencing effects were in accordance with the phenotype previously reported for the clr3-E36 allele (1). For comparison, silencing of the imrR(NcoI)::ura4 and mat3-M::ura4+ marker genes in strains with the hda1Δ or clr6-1 mutation were monitored on the same plates under semirestrictive conditions (30°C) for the clr6-1 temperature-sensitive allele. These strains displayed wild-type or slightly enhanced repression levels in agreement with phenotypes reported earlier (13, 36).

FIG.4.
Clr3 is necessary for silencing of the mating-type region and the rDNA. (A, C, and F) Silencing assays. Cell suspensions were fivefold serially diluted, and each dilution was spotted onto the indicated medium and incubated for 3 days at 30°C. (A) The strains FY498 (wild type [wt]), Hu383 (hda1Δ), Hu379 (clr3Δ), and SPG141 (clr6-1) have the ura4+ gene inserted into the outer repeats of the centromere [imrR(NcoI)::ura4+]. (C) The strains FY597 (wt), FY2606 (hda1Δ), Hu427 (clr3Δ), and Hu460 (clr6-1) have the ura4+ gene inserted next to the mating-type region (mat3-M::ura4+). (F) The strains Hu393 (wt), Hu434 (hda1Δ), Hu395 (clr3Δ), and Hu451 (clr6-1) have the ura4+ gene inserted into the rDNA repeats (rDNA::ura4+). (B, D, and H) FISH experiments with Clr3-myc. Clr3-myc were processed for immunofluorescence microscopy and subjected to FISH. (B) The pRS314 cosmid was used to detect the centromere (green); Clr3-myc appears red. (D) The c1555 probe was used to detect the mat2/3 region (green); Clr3-myc appears red. (H) The rDNA probe was used for FISH (green); Clr3-myc appears red. The pictures were deconvolved (z = 0.2 μm) and merged. Yellow color indicates colocalization. (E) ChIP of Clr3-myc to the mat3-M::ura4+ marker. The strain Hu619 was subjected to ChIP. (G) Hu56 cells were stained against Clr3-myc (green) and (G) Nop1 (red). Pictures were deconvolved (z = 0.2 μm) and merged.

To investigate whether the effects on centromeric and mating-type silencing correlated with the Clr3 protein directly localizing to these regions, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) experiments were carried out. A centromere probe was used to detect the cen region (green) in cells stained for the Clr3-myc fusion protein (red). The Clr3-myc and cen-FISH double-labeled cells were subjected to z-series digital confocal deconvolution analysis (Fig. ​(Fig.4B).4B). The yellow color in merged deconvolved images indicated that Clr3 indeed is present in the cen region. The cosmid c1555, which detects the mat2/3 region in S. pombe (33), was used on cells stained for the Clr3-myc fusion protein. These double-labeled cells were also subjected to z-series digital confocal deconvolution analysis (Fig. ​(Fig.4D).4D). It was evident in the merged picture that the mat2/3-FISH signal (green) partially colocalized with Clr3-myc (red), resulting in a yellow color. To further test if Clr3 was bound to mat2/3 chromatin, a ChIP experiment was carried out (Fig. ​(Fig.4E).4E). To this end, a strain with the ura4+ reporter gene inserted into the mating-type region, mat3-M::ura4, was used. This strain also had a second reporter gene consisting of a mini-ura4 allele, ura4-DS/E, at the endogenous, euchromatic ura4 locus. The ura4-DS/E allele functions as an internal control for the PCR analysis of the DNA recovered from each ChIP experiment (8, 9). In the first lane in Fig. ​Fig.4E,4E, the PCR products from the input of the crude chromatin lysate are shown. The larger band corresponded to the full-length ura4+ gene, and the smaller band corresponded to the internal control, ura4-DS/E. The ratio between the two bands in the crude extracts was set to 1.0. The ratios between the inserted ura4+ and ura4-DS/E genes were normalized to the true ratios of the input crude extract and therefore reflected the relative levels of chromatin immunoprecipitated with the myc antibody. The myc antibody selectively immunoprecipitated chromatin from the mating-type region, resulting in a difference in intensity greater than twofold between the PCR product made from the full-length heterochromatic band and the small euchromatic ura4 band. Taken together, these experiments demonstrate a direct role for Clr3 in the formation of the heterochromatin in the mating-type region.

Clr3 is necessary for rDNA silencing.
To explore whether any of the three HDACs were involved in rDNA silencing of Pol II-transcribed genes in S. pombe, mutations in the HDACs were separately combined with a ura4+ reporter gene integrated into the rDNA arrays (rDNA::ura4+) (42). The resulting strains were compared in the growth assay described above. The wild-type control strain displayed repression of rDNA::ura4+ (Fig. ​(Fig.4F,4F, top row). The repression of rDNA::ura4+ was observed as a 5- to 25-fold-reduced growth on plates lacking uracil and strong growth on FOA-containing plates. The hda1Δ mutation resulted in enhanced silencing of rDNA::ura4+, as revealed by a fivefold-reduced growth on the plate lacking uracil in comparison to that of the wild type (Fig. ​(Fig.4F,4F, first and second rows). This result was not surprising, since the hda1Δ allele had previously been reported to enhance telomeric, centromeric, and mating-type silencing (36). The clr6-1 mutation did not significantly affect expression of rDNA::ura4+ in comparison to wild-type cells (Fig. ​(Fig.4F,4F, bottom lane). The clr3Δ mutation, however, resulted in a strong derepression of rDNA::ura4+, leading to increased growth on plates lacking uracil and a 25-fold reduction in growth on plates containing FOA compared to the wild-type control (Fig. ​(Fig.4F,4F, first and third rows). Thus, Clr3 seemed to be the only one of the S. pombe HDACs tested that was required for silencing of Pol II-transcribed genes inserted into the rDNA repeats. This finding prompted us to investigate the localization of Clr3 in relation to the nucleolus. To this end, we used an antibody against Nop1 (21). The Nop1 protein had previously been described as a nucleolar marker in fission yeast (12). Cells were subjected to indirect immunofluorescence with double labeling of the Clr3-myc fusion protein and Nop1 and z-series digital confocal deconvolution analysis. Although there was less Clr3-myc in the nucleolus than in the rest of the nucleus, the merged deconvolved picture clearly demonstrated a nucleolar localization for a subpopulation of the Clr3-myc protein (Fig. ​(Fig.4G).4G). The presence of Clr3 in the nucleolus was confirmed in a FISH experiment involving an rDNA probe together with Clr3-myc labeling, which resulted in a partial yellow colocalization signal in the merged picture (Fig. ​(Fig.4H).4H). Thus, the silencing and localization studies showed that Clr3 was important for keeping the rDNA regions repressed for Pol II transcription, possibly by directly localizing to the rDNA in the nucleolus.

Differences in the in vivo deacetylation activity of the HDACs.
To determine whether the putative HDACs affect histone acetylation in vivo, a Western analysis of bulk histones was undertaken (8). This assay measures differences in acetylation levels of specific lysine residues for the entire genome in vivo. Bulk histones were prepared from wild-type cells and from strains carrying hda1Δ, clr3Δ, or clr6-1 mutations and submitted to a Western blot analysis with antibodies against specifically acetylated histone H3 or H4 (Fig. ​(Fig.5A).5A). A mutated HDAC was expected to cause an increase, in comparison with wild type, of the signal corresponding to the acetyl group that the enzyme normally removes. The bands were either normalized to the signal from total histone H3, measured with an antibody against the histone H3 C terminus (Fig. ​(Fig.5A,5A, bottom row), or normalized to Coomassie staining of the histones. The measurements were repeated two or three times, and the mean and range of the relative differences in intensity of the wild type and the mutants of each acetylated lysine position were determined (Fig. ​(Fig.5B).5B). The hda1Δ mutant did not show a striking change in bulk acetylation levels compared to the wild-type control. In contrast, the clr6-1 temperature-sensitive mutant under restrictive conditions (36°C) gave strongly elevated acetylation levels of all lysines tested at the histone H3 and H4 amino-terminal tails (Fig. ​(Fig.5A,5A, compare the first and the last lanes; and B, white bar). This observation was consistent with the in vitro activity of the purified Clr6 enzyme, which was found to be active on both acetylated histone H3 and histone H4 substrates (P. Bjerling, K. Ekwall, and S. Grewal, unpublished data). Histones prepared from a clr3Δ strain displayed little variation with respect to the wild-type strain. However, at the one position affected, namely lysine 14 of histone H3, a 4.5-fold increase in the acetylation level compared to that of the wild-type control was detected (Fig. ​(Fig.5A,5A, second row, lanes 1 and 3; and B, third bar). This increase is statistically significant (P < 0.05, one-sample t test). Hence, we conclude that among the S. pombe HDACs, the class I enzyme, Clr6, displays the broadest in vivo specificity, while the class II enzyme, Clr3, displays the most narrow specificity, with a strong preference for acetylated K14 of histone H3.

At the bottom, a Western blot with an antibody against the C terminus of histone H3 is shown as a loading control. (B) The mean and range of the intensity of the bands in two to three experiments are shown.

Deletion of clr3+ results in increased acetylation levels at the mating-type region and the rDNA.
To investigate whether the mating-type region and the rDNA repeat were hypoacetylated and whether the enzymatic activity of Clr3 was necessary to maintain a low acetylation level in these regions, we utilized a ChIP assay, which measures acetylation of specific chromatin targets. The assay was performed with antibodies against histone H3 acetylated at K9 or K14 or antibodies against histone H4 acetylated at K8 or K12. Chromatin extracts were prepared from strains with the ura4+ reporter gene inserted into the chromosomal region of interest and a second reporter gene consisting of a mini-ura4 allele, ura4-DS/E, at the endogenous, euchromatic ura4 locus. Since the clr3Δ mutation was shown to mainly affect silencing at the mating-type region and at the rDNA (Fig. ​(Fig.4),4), the ChIP assays were performed with strains having the ura4+ reporter gene inserted into either of these domains. Figure ​Figure66 shows the results of the ChIP assays. In the first lanes, the PCR products from the input of the crude chromatin lysate are shown. Acetylation levels at all positions tested (histone H3 K9 and K14 and histone H4 K8 and K12) were low in mat3-M::ura4+ chromatin, resulting in ratios between the full-length ura4+ gene and the mini ura4-DS/E gene of 0.07 to 0.14 (Fig. ​(Fig.6A).6A). In contrast, when mat3-M::ura4+ was combined with the clr3Δ mutation, the resulting acetylation levels increased to 0.40 to 0.49 (Fig. ​(Fig.6B).6B). The rDNA region had a generally higher basal acetylation level, with the ChIP measurements of rDNA::ura4+ in a wild-type strain background giving ratios in the range 0.21 to 0.43 (Fig. ​(Fig.6C).6C). The acetylation level of rDNA::ura4+ was further increased in the clr3Δ genetic background to ratios ranging from 0.89 to 1.46 (Fig. ​(Fig.6D).6D). Thus, when the Clr3 enzyme is missing from the cells, the histone acetylation levels increase at least twofold in both the mating-type region and the rDNA repeats at all of the lysine residues tested.

clr3Δ cells exhibit elevated acetylation levels at several lysines in H3 and H4 in the mating-type region and at the rDNA regions. DNA from crude chromatin preparation (crude) and immunoprecipitated (ChIP) chromatin of the indicated strains was amplified by radioactive PCR. The normalized ratios between the two variants of the ura4+ gene (ura4+ and ura4-DS/E) are shown below each lane, and the mean value of duplicate or triplicate experiments is shown underneath. The full-length ura4+ gene was either inserted (A) next to the mating-type region (mat3-M::ura4+) in strains FY597 (wild type) and (B) Hu427 (clr3Δ) or (C) in the rDNA (rDNA::ura4+) in strains Hu393 (wild type) and (D) Hu395 (clr3Δ).
There are three members of the “classical” HDAC family in S. pombe. Previous studies indicated distinct functions for the three enzymes, since the mutants displayed different phenotypes (1, 13, 25, 36). In this study, we reveal some potential explanations for the functional divergence of S. pombe HDACs. First, we show that the S. pombe enzymes belong to evolutionarily distinct classes of HDACs and that these two classes have different conserved amino acid sequences in their L3-L7 loops and in their β4 regions, which together are known to form the active site (11). Next, we demonstrate that the enzymes have different cellular localization patterns. Clr3 and Clr6 were both observed in the nucleus, but in different subnuclear locations. Clr6 was found exclusively on the chromatin, while Clr3 occupied the entire nuclear space, including the chromatin, the nuclear periphery, and the nucleolus. Hda1, on the other hand, was found in the cytoplasm of the cell. In terms of the in vivo specificities, Western analysis of bulk histone preparations indicated that the class I enzyme Clr6 acted on both histones H3 and H4, whereas the class II enzyme Clr3 had a major effect on histone H3 acetylated at position K14. Finally, we demonstrate that clr3Δ is the only one of the three HDACs that is required for rDNA silencing. Thus, the different functions of the S. pombe HDACs can, at least in part, be explained by different cellular localizations and enzymatic activities.

The main in vivo activity of Clr3 is to deacetylate position K14 of histone H3.
We have presented a more detailed analysis of one of the HDACs, namely Clr3. First we showed that clr3+ was not an essential gene by deleting its entire open reading frame. Second, we established that Clr3 was indeed an HDAC, and not only a sequence homologue of known HDACs. Our evidence by Western analysis of bulk histone preparations clearly showed that the clr3Δ null allele caused elevated acetylation levels at histone H3 K14 (Fig. ​(Fig.55).

Furthermore, we demonstrated that the deacetylation of position K14 of histone H3 was crucial for maintaining the heterochromatin structure at the mating-type region and rDNA and that Clr3 was localized to these regions (Fig. ​(Fig.4).4). Taken together, these results strongly argue for a direct role of Clr3 in keeping the mating-type region and the rDNA repeats silenced by deacetylation of position K14 of histone H3.

ChIP analysis indicated that the acetylation of lysines other than K14 of histone H3 is also increased in the clr3Δ mutant, as observed in chromatin associated with the ura4+ reporter gene inserted into the rDNA repeats or the mat2/3 region (Fig. ​(Fig.6).6). The discrepancy between acetylation levels of these specific target genes and those of the bulk histone estimated by Western blot analysis in clr3Δ cells may be explained by assuming that the broad substrate specificity of Clr3 limited to small chromosomal regions that would not lead to an overall increase in acetylation in the bulk measurements. An alternative explanation is that Clr3 may have narrow substrate specificity for deacetylation of lysine K14 on histone H3 and that this activity would be required for subsequent deacetylation events in forming the heterochromatin of these regions. It has been shown that the clr6-1 mutant alone has a minor defect in mat2/3 silencing, whereas the clr3-735 and clr6-1 double mutant shows a strong synergistic reduction of silencing at mat2/3 (13). The synergism between clr3-735 and clr6-1 indicates that these two enzymes jointly keep the mat2/3 region underacetylated. This could explain the discrepancy between our analysis of the enzyme activities in bulk histone preparations (Fig. ​(Fig.5)5) and the ChIP data of mat2/3 chromatin in clr3Δ cells presented in Fig. ​Fig.6.6. These results would also be consistent with a general model for formation of heterochromatin at mat2/3 suggested by reference 35. In this pathway, Clr3 would be required to deacetylate H3AcK14 prior to a more general deacetylation of H3 and H4 by Clr6 allowing for a methylation of H3K9 by Clr4 and subsequent binding of Swi6. The observed differences between the clr6-1 and clr3Δ mutants in the bulk histone preparations could thus be due to the fact that the regions of heterochromatin, where Clr3 and Clr6 activities may be linked, are relatively small as compared to the total S. pombe genome size. Presumably Clr6 and Clr3 functions are not dependent on each other in gene regulation in most other parts of the genome.

Silencing of the heterochromatic regions versus rDNA silencing of Pol II-transcribed genes.
Clr3 is shown to be necessary both for mating-type silencing and silencing of the rDNA. Studies in S. cerevisiae have shown that some of the factors needed for heterochromatic silencing are also important for rDNA silencing, while other factors are unique for one or the other chromatin (37). A similar picture is beginning to emerge in S. pombe. It has been reported previously that the chromo-domain proteins Swi6 and Chp2 and the methyltransferase Clr4 also influence silencing of both heterochromatin and rDNA (42). We show here that the function of Clr3 is also shared between the regions of heterochromatin and the rDNA repeats.

Clr3 localizes to the nucleolus, where it is involved in rDNA silencing. However, the function of rDNA silencing is not known in S. pombe. In S. cerevisiae, defects in rDNA silencing, for example, mutations in SIR2, lead to premature aging (15). In budding yeast, aging is easily monitored by the fraction of old cells with many bud scars in the cell population. In S. pombe, however, such an analysis is not feasible, since fission yeast divides by binary fission and bud scars are not easily recognizable.

A cytoplasmatic localization of Hda1.
The observed strengthening of silencing in an S. pombe hda1Δ strain background is not easily interpreted, since this mutation did not cause significant changes in the histone acetylation, as measured by ChIP at these loci (K. Ekwall, unpublished data). Hda1 could enhance silencing indirectly by affecting the transcription of a silencing factor or the formation of a specific acetylation pattern of histones in heterochromatin that was not detected in our bulk analysis. A recent paper discusses both of these mechanisms as a possible cause for obtaining enhanced silencing in an S. cerevisiae rpd3Δ strain (3). The unexpected cytoplasmic localization of Hda1 suggests a third possible explanation. Since Hda1 is found in the cytoplasm throughout the cell cycle, the protein is not in the same compartment as the heterochromatin, and thus the lack of Hda1 must indirectly influence the heterochromatin. Hda1 may counteract the cytoplasmic B-type HATs, creating a balance that optimizes the level and pattern of acetylation of the histones for nuclear import and nucleosome assembly. There is some evidence that the acetylation patterns are crucial for import and assembly. For example, when the N-terminal tail of histone H3 is removed, histone H4 needs to be acetylated at one or more of the positions K5, K8, or K12 for nucleosome deposition onto newly replicated DNA to occur (31). It is also possible that the cytoplasmic localization of Hda1 is not permanent, but that the protein is, perhaps transiently, translocated into the nucleus under certain conditions. Cytoplasmic localization of HDACs has also been reported for human HDAC4 and -5. These HDACs have been shown to move between cytoplasm and nucleus with the help of 14-3-3 proteins, where they repress MEF2-regulated genes (14, 32). It will be interesting to test whether Hda1 protein can be translocalized into the nucleus under particular conditions. Yet another possible function of Hda1 is that the enzyme might deacetylate nonhistone proteins similar to HDAC1 regulation of p53 in human cells by deacetylation (30).

Comparison of S. pombe and S. cerevisiae HDACs of class I and class II.
We have concluded that the main in vivo activity of Clr3 is to reduce acetylation level at histone H3 lysine 14. The closest relative to Clr3 in S. cerevisiae is HDA1 (Fig. ​(Fig.1A).1A). ChIP assays on an S. cerevisiae strain lacking HDA1 shows a drastic increase in acetylation of histone H3 and H2B at the ENA1 promoter, while histone H4 is unaffected (45). Assuming that changes at the ENA1 promoter reflect the general activity of HDA1, it is possible that both of these class II enzymes primarily act on histone H3 in vivo.

In the clr6-1 mutant background, the in vivo acetylation levels were strongly increased at all positions examined in both histones H3 and H4. The closest homologue to Clr6 in S. cerevisiae is Rpd3. An rpd3 mutant strain exhibits increased acetylation levels at all lysine positions in histones H3, H4, H2A, and H2B at the INO1 promoter (38). Thus, both the class I HDAC enzymes SpClr6 and ScRPD3 seem to show a broad in vivo specificity. These differences in enzymatic activity between class I and class II enzymes might be the result of striking differences in their amino acid sequences observed between the two classes in the L3-L7 loops and the β4 region of the enzymatic core (Fig. ​(Fig.1B)1B) (11). Perhaps these differences in the primary sequences reflect differences in the tertiary structure resulting in a more stringent substrate binding capacity for the class II enzymes.

It remains to be seen to what extent these similarities within the different classes of HDACs reflect conserved functions in the different organisms. Interestingly, the closest homologue to S. pombe Hda1 is S. cerevisiae HOS2. A deletion of S. pombe hda1Δ causes a defect in sporulation, a defect also displayed by an S. cerevisiae strain deleted for hos2Δ (4, 36). Thus, some regulated target genes of these two proteins might be shared between the two distantly related yeasts.

Nuclear foci for gene repression.
In this study, we demonstrated that both Clr3 and Clr6 HDAC had spotted localization patterns in the nuclei of S. pombe cells. This finding is not without precedent, since studies with mammalian cells also revealed such spotted localization patterns for HDAC1, HDAC5, and HDAC7 (7, 24). The HDAC1 protein forms heterochromatic foci in lymphocytes, which contain, among other proteins, the Ikaros protein and the Mi2 chromatin remodeling factor (24). In lymphocytes, developmental genes are regulated by selective recruitment to Ikaros foci leading to gene repression. Perhaps a similar mechanism with repression foci operates in the simple S. pombe system.

Taken together, our results indicate that HDACs have evolved highly divergent cellular functions. The distinct localization and specificity for different lysine residues of histone H3 and H4 of the different HDACs underlie the different phenotypes they display when mutated. Perhaps the explanation for the differences in enzymatic activity lies in the differences in amino acid sequences of the pocket domain between class I and class II HDACs.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' Open Payments program implements Section 6002 of the Affordable Care Act requiring medical product manufacturers to report payments made to physicians or teaching hospitals, as well as ownership or investment interests held by physicians in the manufacturer. To determine the characteristics and distribution of these industry payments by specialty, we analyzed physician payments made between August 1, 2013 and December 31, 2013 that were publicly disclosed by Open Payments. We compared payments between specialty type (grouped as medical, surgical, and other specialties) and across specialties within each type, using Pearson's chi square test and the Kruskal-Wallis test. The number of physicians receiving payments was compared to the total number of active physicians in each specialty in 2012. We also analyzed physician ownership interests. There were 2.7 million identified payments to recipient physicians totaling $527 million. Allopathic and osteopathic physicians received 2.43 million payments totaling $475 million. General payments represented 90% ($430 million) of payments by total value (per-physician median:$100, IQR:$31-$273, mean:$1,407, SD:$23,766) with the remaining 10% ($45 million) as research payments (median:$2,365, IQR:$592-$8,550; mean:$12,880, SD:$66,743). Physicians most likely to receive general payments were cardiovascular specialists (78%) and neurosurgeons (77%); those least likely were pathologists (9%). Reports of ownership interest in reporting entities included $310 million in dollar amount invested and $447 million in value of interest held by 2,093 physicians. In conclusion, the distribution and characteristics of industry payments to physicians varied widely by specialty during the first half-year of Open Payments reporting.

The recently debuted Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' (CMS) Open Payments transparency program establishes a national database of industry payments to physicians and teaching hospitals1. Financial relationships between medical product manufacturers and physicians have long been a source of concern to patients and policymakers alike. These concerns have grown in recent years as research continues to show the ways in which these widely prevalent relationships2 may affect treatment decisions and may drive healthcare costs due to inappropriate utilization3,4. In their report calling for broad transparency of industry-physician relationships, the Institute of Medicine “defines a conflict of interest as existing when an individual or institution has a secondary interest (…) that creates a risk of undue influence on decisions or actions affecting a primary interest (e.g., the conduct of objective and trustworthy medical research). This definition frames a conflict of interest in terms of the risk of such undue influence and not the actual occurrence of bias3.” In many cases, industry-physician financial relationships, from transfers of value as small as a meal or gift to those for royalties and licensing fees, create a conflict of interest3,4,5.

As a result of concerns about these financial conflicts of interest, several legislative efforts have been made over the years to increase transparency with respect to industry-physician relationships. Prior to Open Payments implementation, several states enacted laws requiring various levels of disclosure of industry payments to physicians6, including full transparency, disclosure to the state, compliance with professional guidelines7, and limits on gifts. However, only 8 states had such laws prior to Open Payments implementation6. In addition to these laws, several pharmaceutical and device manufacturers publicly disclosed payments, though with varying detail8. Kesselheim et al., in their evaluation of Massachusetts physician payment transparency data, found wide variation among specialties9. They speculated that there may be differences in industry incentive to engage in such relationships or that specialties may have differences in the acceptance of these relationships.

Federal policymakers have attempted to increase transparency of industry-physician financial relationships, though attempts between 2002 and 2009 failed to gain enough support for the bills to pass10-12. Finally, in 2010, the Physician Payment Sunshine Act was signed into law as Section 6002 of President Obama's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act13, leading to the establishment of the Open Payments program. The stated goal of the Sunshine Act and Open Payments is to “shed light on the nature and extent of [industry-physician] relationships and […] hopefully discourage the development of inappropriate relationships and help prevent the increased and potentially unnecessary health care costs that can arise from such conflicts13.” The Open Payments data release was updated in December 2014 and includes 4.5 million records of $3.7 billion in total value for payments occurring between August 1, 2013 and December 31, 2013. These data, despite representing only five months of 2013, are the most comprehensive to date describing physician-industry relationships in the United States. Physician payments reported to Open Payments include payments of greater than $10 or $100 in aggregate annually (adjusted based on the consumer price index) with notable exceptions that include product samples, discounts, charity care, and patient educational materials1.

Much of the existing literature on the Open Payments program is speculative, published prior to the availability of the data, but provide important insight into the possible uses and impact of the data. For example, Rosenthal and Mello14 speculated on the use of Open Payments data by attorneys, insurance carriers, researchers, policymakers, and patients14. The debate on the influence of conflicts of interest on physician decision-making is ongoing14-16, with researchers acknowledging that there is little evidence to answer such questions. Analysis of these newly available data may bring better understanding of the differences and commonalities between specialties in their relationships with industry. Such knowledge may help to determine how to assess the appropriateness of these relationships and their effects on clinical practice, as well as help inform evidence-based advocacy efforts as ongoing federal transparency efforts shift the landscape of disclosure for physicians.

The purpose of our study was to characterize Open Payments program records of industry payments to physicians and determine how these payments vary by specialty. We hypothesized that there would be differences in the characteristics and distribution of payments by physician specialty.
The Open Payments database allows for physician-level industry payment calculations and aggregation for analysis of broader characteristics by specialty. We performed a retrospective analysis of the most recent (December 2014) publicly available release of Open Payments data on industry payments (>$10 or $100 in aggregate annually) to identified physicians made between August 1, 2013 and December 31, 2013. CMS excludes resident and manufacturer employee physicians. The data released also include payments to teaching hospitals, but these are beyond the scope of this article. Payments to recipient physicians were available in both identified and de-identified databases. Identified physician payments included records of payments or other transfer of value (‘physician payments’) to a specific physician and included physician specialty designation. ‘Recipient physicians’ include both allopathic and osteopathic specialties as well as other practitioners designated as physicians by CMS. We further limited our analysis to allopathic and osteopathic physician specialties that could be matched with the AMA masterfile count of active physicians17. Data were aggregated by physician specialty type (medical, surgical, and other) and by specialty:

medical specialties: allergy & immunology, dermatology, family medicine & general practice, cardiovascular disease, gastroenterology, internal medicine, pediatrics, and pediatric cardiology;

surgical specialties: colorectal surgery, neurosurgery, obstetrics & gynecology, ophthalmology, oral and maxillofacial surgery, orthopedic surgery, otolaryngology, plastic surgery, surgery (general), thoracic surgery, and urology; and,

other specialties: anesthesiology, emergency medicine, neurology, pathology, psychiatry, radiology, and other.

A listing of the specialty groupings is provided to delineate specialty taxonomy used for this analysis (see eTable 1). Records include information on reporting manufacturers, physicians, payments, associated drug or device, and ownership interests.

We characterized payments by ‘type’ (general or research). General payments include all forms of payment other than for research activities, which are classified under research payments (defined below). General payments were also characterized by ‘form’ of payment or the modality used to transfer payment, including: cash or cash equivalent (‘cash’); in-kind items and services (‘in-kind’); dividend, profit or other return on investment (‘ROI’); or stock, stock option or other ownership interest (‘ownership interest’). General payments are further classified by ‘nature’ of payment or the reason the general payment was made. CMS provides descriptive titles for each nature of payment classification and has examples of payment types that were developed with stakeholder input available on their website (available at: https://www.cms.gov/OpenPayments/About/Natures-of-Payment.html, accessed June 15, 2015). We have provided an adapted version of the CMS descriptions in eTable 2.

Research payments include any direct compensation, funding for coordination or implementation, or study participant expense payment associated with research activities1. Research is defined in the regulations as “a systematic investigation designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge relating broadly to public health, including behavioral and social-sciences research. This term encompasses basic and applied research and product development1.” Research-related payments are reported separately from general payments due to the complexity of research programs1. In addition, certain research payments qualify for delayed publication if they are related to new, additional applications of, or clinical investigations regarding a drug, biologic, device or medical supply1. Research payments are not required to report an expenditure category (similar to nature of payment for general payments) because there are often multiple, although the option to report such a category is available. 91% of research payment records did not specify an expenditure category; therefore we did not further explore this classification. We present summarized aggregate data, data by specialty type, and data by physician specialty (organized by specialty type). Payment characteristics analyzed included number of payment reports, value of payments, and the per-physician median and mean payment amount.

Lastly, we characterized physician and immediate family member ownership interests in manufacturers. ‘Ownership interests’ include any ownership or investment interests of physicians or immediate family members in a reporting entity (applicable manufacturer or group purchasing organization) required to report payments1. Ownership interest include stocks, stock options, partnership shares, limited liability company membership(s), loans, bond or other financial instruments secured by the reporting entity; notable exclusions include ownership interest received as compensation (until exercised), as part of a retirement plan, or interest in a publicly traded security or mutual fund1. Unless listed under general payments, ownership interests must be held within the defined reporting period but are not necessarily transferred. To characterize ownership and investment interest data, we utilized CMS terms “amount invested” and “value of interest” to delineate the original amount of the interest holding or transfer of value and the “cumulative value” of that ownership interest in the reporting entity at the end of the reporting period, respectively18. Ownership interest characteristics analyzed included number of ownership interests held, and the total and per-physician median dollar amount invested and value of interest.

We analyzed how payment and ownership interest characteristics vary between specialty types and across physician specialties within each type using Pearson Chi-square test and the Kruskal-Wallis test where applicable. We compared the number of physicians receiving payments to the total number of active physicians in each specialty in 201217 to estimate the proportion of physicians receiving payment and holding ownership interest.
From August 1, 2013 to December 31, 2013, there were 4.4 million payments totaling $2.6 billion reported to Open Payments with 2.7 million of these payments ($869 million) disclosed in an identified manner. General payments represented 4.2 million ($1.0 billion) of all payments, and 2.7 million ($693 million) of the identified payments. Recipient physicians received 4.2 million ($761 million) of all general payments, and identified recipient physicians received 2.6 million payments totaling $476 million. The nature of all general payments to recipient physicians and the subset of identified payments are presented in Table 1. Nature of identified general payments to recipient physicians by total value was primarily compensation for services [$113 million (24%)], royalty/license [$107 million (22%)], and consulting fees [$94 million (20%)]; by number of records, they were primarily food/beverage [2.2 million (84%)].

Allopathic and osteopathic physicians received 2.4 million payments totaling $475 million (Table 2). Figure 1 shows the distribution of payments among allopathic and osteopathic specialties. Internal medicine and orthopedic surgery had the greatest total value ($111 million each), Figure 1a; however, payments were distributed to a greater number of internal medicine physicians vs. orthopedic surgeons (77,515 vs. 15,459, respectively). Medical specialties that received the greatest number of payments were cardiovascular disease and gastroenterology (78% and 68%, respectively). The proportion of physicians receiving payment was significantly different between specialty types and by specialty within each type (P < .001 for all tests). Form of payments (Figure 1) was primarily cash [$367 million (77%) by value, 469,557 (19%) by number] or in-kind [$103 million (22%) by value, 2.0 million (81%) by number], with the remaining payments as ROI [$421,769 (0.1%) by value, 48 (<0.1%) by number) and ownership interest [$4.8 million (1%) by value, 66 (<0.1%) by number].

Data include payments to identified physicians in allopathic and osteopathic specialties. Form of payment is the modality used to transfer payment, including: cash or cash equivalent (‘cash’); in-kind items and services (‘in-kind’); dividend, profit or other return on investment (‘ROI’); or stock, stock option or other ownership interest (‘ownership interest’)

*The proportion of payments in each form of payment category was significantly different across specialties within each type (Pearson's chi-square test, all P < .001).

†The proportion of physicians receiving payment was significantly different across specialties within each type (Pearson's chi-squared test, all P < .001).

#The per-physician value of general payments was significantly different across specialties within each type (Kruskal-Wallis test, all P < .001).

bAll identified payments includes payments to an identified recipient physician, regardless of the type of payment (research or general). All identified general payments include the subset of payments made for any reason other than for research.
cCalculated using the number of active physicians for each specialty in 2012 obtained from AMA masterfile data (American Medical Association,17 2013).
dThe proportion of physicians paid differed significantly between specialty types and across specialties within each type (Pearson's chi-squared test, P < .001 for all comparisons)
eThe value of general payments differed significantly between specialty types and across specialties within each type (Kruskal-Wallis test, P < .001 for all comparisons)
fDue to rounding, some of the totals may not correspond to the sum of the subtotals.
General payments represented $430 million (90%) of the total value of payments to allopathic and osteopathic physicians (per-physician median:$100, IQR:$31-$273, mean:$1,407, SD: $23,766) and 2.4 million (99%) of the number of records. The remaining $45 million (10%) of the total value were research payments (median:$2,365, IQR:$592-$8,550; mean:$12,880,SD:$66,743). Thoracic surgery, cardiovascular disease, and urology had the highest median general payments; and, orthopedic surgery, neurosurgery and neurology had the highest mean value of general payments per-physician (Figure 1b). The value of general payments was significantly different between specialty types and by specialty within each type (P < .001 for all tests). The distribution of the nature of payments by specialty type can be found in Figure 2a, Figure 2b, and eTable 3. Surgical specialties had the greatest proportion of general payments for royalty/license [$89 million (47%) in value, 2,431 (<1%) by number]. Royalty/license payments to surgical specialties encompassed 89% of the $100 million total royalty/license payments made for all specialty types. The proportion of general payments in each nature of payment category differed significantly between specialty types and by specialty within each type (P < .001 for all tests).

†The proportion of general payments in each nature of payment category was significantly different when compared between specialty types (Pearson's chi-squared test, all P < .001).

Manufacturers also disclosed 3,296 reports of 2,093 individual physicians (0.3% of all physicians) with ownership interest (Table 3) totaling $310 million in total dollar amount invested (median:$12,520, IQR:$3,114-$50,050) and $447 million in total value of interest (median:$15,640, IQR:$4,747-$72,880). We found significant differences in the total dollar amount invested between specialty types and by specialty within each type (Kruskal-Wallis test, P < .001 between specialty types, and by specialty within medical and surgical specialties; P =.001 by specialty within other specialties). We also found that total value of interest between specialty types and by specialty within each type were significantly different for each comparison (P < .001 between specialty types, and by specialty within medical and surgical specialties), except for by specialty within other specialties (P = .11). Specialties most likely to have ownership interests were urology [583 of 10,773 (5%)], neurosurgery [117 of 6,041 (2%)], and orthopedic surgery [385 of 25,670 (2%)]. All other specialties had <1% of physicians with ownership interest. We found significant differences in the proportion of physicians with ownership interest by specialty type and by specialty within each specialty type (P < .001 for all tests).

Our analysis of this unprecedented volume of physician-specific data on industry-related financial conflicts of interest shows wide variability in the prevalence and characteristics of industry payments to physicians by specialty. While important analyses of Open Payments manufacturer and product data exist19,20, little attention has been paid to characteristics of physician data. A report by Jarvies et al.20 gave an initial account of the first release of Open Payments data in September 2014, focusing largely on manufacturer and product data. However, the data provided regarding physician specialties were limited to 5 specialties and provided aggregates that included ownership and investment interests in the totals, despite the difference in reporting of these records. Useful aggregation and analyses of Open Payments manufacturer and product data are also available from ProPublica19 and from CMS in their recent report to Congress21, although little attention has been paid to characteristics of physician data. Prior to the enactment of Open Payments, ProPublica also assembled a separate important database of industry-physician financial relatinships22 containing $4 billion in payments disclosed by 17 pharmaceutical companies between 2009 and 2013. In comparison to the 4 year period evaluated by ProPublica, the Open Payments data presented herein reports on a 5 month period that contains data on nearly the same total value of payments ($3.7 billion in total).

Our findings are also important because the specialty variation in our analysis demonstrates that further interpretation of the impact of industry payments on physician decision-making, healthcare costs and utilization must incorporate the specialty-specific context of these data. We found significant differences in the distribution and median values of payments by specialty type as well as by specialty within each type. We found that general medical specialties (internal medicine and family medicine/general practice,) were the target of a large proportion of industry payments (1.2 million (50%) of 2.4 million total) though the value of these payments tended to be lower than other specialties [$133 million (28%) of $475 million paid to allopathic and osteopathic specialties in our analysis]. In addition, the medical specialties that involve a greater amount of intervention (cardiovascular disease, gastroenterology and dermatology) had the highest proportion of physicians receiving industry payments. Our data are consistent with prior evidence showing wide variation among specialties in an early evaluation of Massachusetts physician payment transparency data9 as well as in physician self-reports2,23. These evaluations also found a high prevalence of payments with specialty variability, as well as high values of payments attributed to cardiology and orthopedic surgery. In addition, our data differ from the Massachusetts data in the nature of payments by providing additional detail to the distribution of payments, where a large proportion of Massachusetts payments fell under the broad category of “compensation for bona fide services9.” Other analyses of Open Payments data also found similar variation amongst a limited number of surgical specialties24-26, although a comprehensive analysis of medical and other specialties is absent. Certain specialties may have greater research and development involvement resulting in royalty and licensing payments27. Comparisons between surgical, medical and other specialties in our findings show distinct payment distributions and characteristics in each specialty type, with greater royalty and licensing payments in surgical specialties compared to medical and other specialties. In addition, our findings are consistent with an analysis showing the broad extent of financial interaction between orthopedic surgery and industry26, a field with long-standing financial relationships28 and a history of recent problematic relationships with device manufacturers influencing the dissemination of research results29,27.

Whether transparency will impede valuable collaborations and the pace of innovation also requires ongoing evaluation, as does further investigation into the appropriateness of these financial relationships. For example, the influence of payments of greater value (orthopedic surgery received 80,951 (3%) of payments by number and $111 million (23%) of $475 million by value) cannot necessarily be interpreted under the same criteria as payments to other specialties. However, implications of these payments are complex; and, the prevalence and magnitude of payments seen in these data increase the need for further research into the effect of these payments, both beneficial and problematic. Research has shown that physician payment laws may deter physician-industry relationships that create conflicts of interest6,15. Physicians may be less likely to accept industry payments15, and manufacturers may be less likely to pay physicians and shift these expenditures towards direct-to-consumer advertising and towards payers30. But there is also some debate as to whether an unintended consequence of transparency of physician payments may result in allowing such payments to be more rather than less influential because they have been disclosed31 due to discounting by informed patients or a feeling of moral license after having disclosed such a relationship. Moreover, others16 have found that the effects of transparency are small in deterring utilization of higher priced drugs, for example. Many have expressed concern with the limitations of the Open Payments program, citing the inaccuracies of the database32, the short review period33, and the value assigned to research payments due to the high price of drugs34. Additionally, others are concerned that payment transparency, if not properly contextualized, will deter physicians from entering even those relationships that are beneficial, out of concern that such payments will be misconstrued as problematic32.

Our study adds to the current literature by providing a comprehensive analysis of Open Payments physician-level data with specialty-specific analyses to evaluate differences in the distribution and characteristics of payments. Now that Open Payments data are publicly available, despite criticisms of the data released thus far35, physicians must understand what is being reported, how to engage efficiently and effectively with Open Payments, and how to manage questions from patients and other interested parties. Manufacturers are not required to inform physicians that certain payments must be reported, nor is physician participation in the program required; thus, educating physicians on transparency data is critical to physician awareness. CMS estimates that 50% of physicians will have a reported financial relationship with industry1. We estimate that 40% (324,523) of all allopathic and osteopathic physicians (813,123) received identified payments, nearly meeting CMS estimates, though we expect that the actual proportion is greater. The remaining 1.7 million de-identified records may include up to 546,000 total physicians (68% of physicians by our estimates), but the actual number is unclear due to provider identifier inconsistencies1. CMS also excluded 190,000 records due to delay in publication requests. In addition, manufacturers must now report payments for accredited CME activities made in 2016 and beyond. Moreover, if payers incorporate Open Payments data into certain quality and utilization measures used for reimbursement14, more physicians are likely to review their reports. Acknowledging the potential for an increase in physicians engaging with Open Payments will ensure that the proper support and resources are available.

While CMS suggests that Open Payments data be combined with quality and utilization data to improve understanding of these relationships1, no unique physician identifier is publicly available to facilitate comparison to other quality and utilization, research publication, or funding databases to facilitate effective analysis. Industry reporting of payments must include a National Provider Identifier (NPI), however the law itself prohibits publication of NPIs with Open Payments data. CMS implemented a search tool to help identify payments by physician or manufacturer name, but does not enable broader aggregation and analysis. However, searching for payments to an individual physician still provides organizations the opportunity to verify conflicts of interest and make more informed decisions on physician participation in influential decision making and developing guidelines. There is also ongoing debate into whether or not some payments deserve exclusion36, with recent federal efforts to allow payments related to accredited CME activities to be excluded from reporting requirements based on the recent changes made by CMS discussed above for the 2016 reporting year.

The extent to which patients' knowledge of industry-physician relationships will impact their decision making is unclear3. Research into the opinion of patients regarding industry-physician financial conflicts of interest has shown that patients in clinical trials largely (90%) expressed little to no concern about the financial ties, although many wanted disclosure of these interests (31%)37. In addition, a survey or orthopedic surgery patients found that they largely viewed financial relationships for surgeons acting as consultants for device manufacturers as beneficial38. Nevertheless, proper contextualization of payments is an ongoing concern for physicians and specialty societies, given the potential for misinterpretation by patients or the media, and the potential for use in liability claims. Industry collaborations in research are increasingly important as a result of stagnating government-funded support28,29,39. In a commentary on the potential unintended effects of Open Payments on oncology care, one author suggests that given the assignment of industry publication expenses being attributed to a physician, that important research findings may be delayed and that researchers may be reluctant to engage in industry-supported research40. Our data establish important elements of payment context that may help to mitigate such reluctance, and ongoing assessment of the appropriateness of industry-physician relationships may help ensure that disclosure does not adversely affect beneficial relationships that are becoming more common, and will deter those that are inappropriate. Furthermore, such payments for publication expenses, if reported correctly, would be included in a research payment if subject to an agreement, contract or research protocol, and the separate reporting of research payments should mitigate certain concerns, especially as the program and reporting entity experience with the Open Payment system matures and physicians become more involved.

Our study has limitations. First, our study is limited by restricting our analysis to identified physician payments–payments linked to a physician with total confidence–excluding 1.7 million records. Accordingly, we likely underestimated the proportion of physicians receiving industry payments and as such, the generalizability of our data is limited. Also, we were unable to assess specialty-level systematic differences in the excluded data. However, the distribution of de-identified general payments by nature was similar to identified payments (Table 1), and we do not expect that errors leading to provider identification introduce large systematic bias, though it cannot be ruled out. Ongoing analyses of upcoming data releases will be an important step in verifying our findings and analyzing how they change over time. CMS also excluded 190,000 records due to delay in publication requests, many of which may have been for proprietary drugs or devices. Accordingly, incidence of physician payments may be underestimated and we could not account for potential systematic differences in excluded records or inaccuracies inherent to the database. CMS does not publish NPIs in the public use dataset, therefore incorporation of demographic and other data of interest is limited.

The Open Payments data and our analyses, while important, demonstrate the need to test the effects of financial conflicts of interest on physician behavior and those of transparency itself in prospective interventional studies. In addition, the variability of our data between specialties demonstrate a potential need for specialty-specific advocacy as federal transparency programs and their broad availability evolve.
Our analysis provides important insights into the specialty differences in industry-related conflicts of interest as the nation's physician workforce enters an era of transparency for industry-physician relationships. These data can inform transparency policy-making and advocacy efforts by specialty organizations and guide further research efforts to measure the effect of transparency on physician and patient decision-making and how industry-physician relationships change over time.

Kaempferia parviflora (KP) has been reported to have anti-cancer activities. We previously reported its effects against cervical cancer cells and continued to elucidate the effects of KP on inhibiting the production and secretion of interleukin (IL)-6, as well as its relevant signaling pathways involved in cervical tumorigenesis. We discovered that KP suppressed epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced IL-6 secretion in HeLa cells, and it was associated with a reduced level of Glycoprotein 130 (GP130), phosphorylated signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3), and Mcl-1. Our data clearly showed that KP has no effect on nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) localization status. However, we found that KP inhibited EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of tyrosine 1045 and tyrosine 1068 of EGF receptor (EGFR) without affecting its expression level. The inhibition of EGFR activation was verified by the observation that KP significantly suppressed a major downstream MAP kinase, ERK1/2. Consistently, KP reduced the expression of Ki-67 protein, which is a cellular marker for proliferation. Moreover, KP potently inhibited phosphorylation of STAT3, Akt, and the expression of Mcl-1 in response to exogenous IL-6 stimulation. These data suggest that KP suppresses EGF-induced production of IL-6 and inhibits its autocrine IL-6/STAT3 signaling critical for maintaining cancer cell progression. We believe that KP may be a potential alternative anti-cancer agent for suppressing cervical tumorigenesis.

Although there is accumulating information on the biology of cervical cancer leading to advances in anti-cancer drug development, human cervical cancer is still one of the leading causes of death in women worldwide [1]. Interestingly, previous studies have revealed a strong link between cervical cancer and inflammatory cytokine signaling [2]. It has been reported that the high-risk human papilloma virus (HPV) 16 infection induces constitutive activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling [3]. HPV positive cancer cell lines such as HeLa (HPV18 positive) retained markedly higher levels of STAT3 phosphorylation at both Y705 and S727 residues compared with the HPV negative cell lines (C33A, DoTc2) [4].

Human IL-6 activates tyrosine kinase activity [5] and then triggers signaling cascades through the Janus family kinases (JAK)/STAT, Ras/MAPK, and PI3K/Akt pathways [6]. Specifically, upon interleukin (IL)-6 receptor activation, STAT3 is phosphorylated [7] and enhances cancer cell growth, survival, and immune evasion [3,8]. IL-6 has been proven to induce epithelial–mesenchymal transition in human cervical carcinoma cells via STAT3 activation [9]. Interestingly, IL-6 also enhances cervical cancer cell survival by upregulating the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1, which is mediated through the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway [10]. Recently, it has been clearly demonstrated that the autocrine and paracrine actions of IL-6 are essential for STAT3 activation in HPV18-positive cervical cancer cell lines (SW756 and HeLa) [4]. In particular, this study revealed that activation of an IL-6 signaling axis drives the autocrine and paracrine phosphorylation of STAT3 within HPV-positive cervical cancers cells, and that activation of this pathway is essential for cervical cancer cell proliferation and survival.

Besides cytokines, binding of growth factors to their specific receptors can lead to the activation of STAT3, which typically involves phosphorylation of the tyrosine (Y) 705 of STAT3 [11]. STAT3 phosphorylation is primarily mediated by receptor-associated kinases such as Janus family kinases (JAK) and receptor tyrosine kinases including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) [12,13]. Phosphorylated STAT3 stimulates cell proliferation, apoptosis, immune regulation, and differentiation [14]. Furthermore, the expression of EGFR is associated with HPV infection [15]. Clinically, it has been shown that levels of EGFR and human papilloma virus (HPV)-E6 and E7 proteins are increased in the cervical epithelial cells of HPV-positive women with cervical cancer [16]. It indicates that HPV-positive cancer cells are sensitive to extracellular stimulation by EGF. This statement is supported by the study in CaSki and HeLa cells, showing that exogenous EGF stimulation enhances cell proliferation by activating EGFR and cyclin D1, which is independent of COX-2 levels, suggesting that the inhibitors of EGFR and cyclin D1 may be effective against cervical cancer cell proliferation. Specifically, the E5 protein of HPV type 16 binds to a subunit of the protein pump ATPase, which consequently leads to reduced degradation of EGFR, an increase in EGFR recycling, and overexpression of EGFR [17,18,19]. Moreover, expression of high-risk HPV E6 is associated with the increased level of EGFR [20]. Additionally, a high level of expression of EGFR was found to be correlated with a high density of Ki-67 positively-stained nuclei in severe dysplasia and carcinoma in situ, indicating a high proliferative state of cervical cancer cells [21]. Interestingly, a previous study has revealed that there is cross-talk between EGFR and IL-6 that drives oncogenic signaling [22]. This study demonstrated that newly synthesized IL-6 drives association of the IL-6 receptor and glycoprotein 130 (gp130) with EGFR, leading to EGFR-dependent rephosphorylation of STAT3. This phenomenon, where both IL-6 secretion and EGFR levels are often elevated, creates a perfect environment for cancer development and progression. Importantly, effective cytotoxic treatment options for advanced cervical cancer are exceedingly limited. The most commonly used cytotoxic therapy, cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy, has produced response rates ranging from 20% to 30% and overall survival rates of less than 10 months [23,24,25,26]. Because of this minimal success with cytotoxic therapies for cervical cancer, interest has increased in targeted therapeutics for the treatment of cervical cancer. For instance, Cetuximab, a chimeric immunoglobulin G2 monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to EGFR and competitively inhibits the binding of EGF and other ligands [27], has been developed to be used in patients with different cancers with high expression of EGFR including cervical cancers. Particularly, preclinical models have shown an exquisite sensitivity of cervical cancer to Cetuximab-mediated inhibition of tumor growth, and in this case, the antibody drug by itself does not directly induce cancer cell death, but suppresses the growth signaling [28]. On the basis of these previous studies suggesting the roles of IL-6 in cervical cancer development and progression, and the fact that cervical cancer cells have high EGFR expression, the discovery of agents that can be used in combination to suppress both IL-6/STAT3 and EGFR signal transduction pathways would possibly result in better treatment outcomes for cervical cancer.

Kaempferia parviflora (KP) has been used as a folk remedy to treat various diseases including cancer. We previously demonstrated that the ethanolic extract of KP, with methoxyflavones as major constituents, exhibited strong anti-cancer activities against HeLa cervical cancer cells by suppressing the MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways stimulated with EGF [29]. Our previous study screened for the effects of KP at both toxic and non-toxic concentration ranges, and we successfully defined that KP at toxic concentrations induces HeLa cell death via intrinsic apoptotic pathway, and KP at non-toxic concentrations still possesses anti-cancer activities in which the extract does not directly induce cell death, but is able to suppress crucial molecular signaling in HeLa cervical cancer cells. One of our interesting findings was that KP at non-toxic concentrations interferes with EGF-stimulated growth and survival signal transduction pathways and inhibits cancer cell migration and invasion. However, the effects of KP at non-cytotoxic concentration on other important signaling pathways stimulated with EGF remain largely unexplored. In the current study, we continued our investigations to understand more about the anti-cancer activities of KP at various non-toxic concentrations by investigating the effects of KP on EGF-induced IL-6 production, and its relevant signaling pathways in an HPV18-positive cervical cancer cell line, HeLa. Because the extract at toxic concentrations can kill a majority of cells, and this eventually affects the level of intracellular proteins and the phosphorylation status, we thus studied the effects of KP at non-toxic concentrations to ensure that the reduction of all protein level and the phosphorylation status is not caused by cell death, but from the authentic properties of KP on interfering certain signal transduction pathways influenced by EGF. Thus, to further increase our understanding of its anti-cancer activities and to further support the use of KP in traditional medicine, we sought to expand our previous study by attempting to address whether KP has the ability to interfere with IL-6 production and secretion, as well as STAT3 activation in HeLa cells. We also defined a possible molecular mechanism of action of KP in suppressing IL-6/STAT3 signaling. Our study provides accumulated evidence that KP suppresses EGF-dependent growth/survival and IL-6/STAT3 signal transduction pathways, at least in part, through blocking the activation of EGFR. Also, results indicate that KP can impede the anti-apoptotic role of interleukin-6, which is normally required for maintaining cervical cancer cell survival [4].

As KP exhibits the ability to impede the tumorigenic influence of EGFR and IL-6 signaling in HeLa cells, we believe that KP could be a good candidate to be developed as an agent for treating HPV18-positive cervical cancer.
The major chemical constituents of the ethanolic extract from Kaempferia parviflora were determined by high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) in comparison with nine standard compounds. The chromatogram of KP extract was identified by comparing their retention times to those of the standard methoxyflavones (Figure 1A,B). The results indicated that KP ethanolic extract contains methoxyflavones as major compounds, which are 3,5,7,3′,4′-pentamethoxyflavone (1), 5,7,4′-trimethoxyflavone (2), 3,5,7-trimethoxyflavone (3), 3,5,7,4′-tetramethoxyflavone (4), 5-hydroxy-3,7,3′,4′-tetramethoxyflavone (5), 5-hydroxy-7-methoxyflavone (6), 5-hydroxy-7,4′-dimethoxyflavone (7), 5-hydroxy-3,7-dimethoxyflavone (8), and 5-hydroxy-3,7,4′-trimethoxyflavone (9). The structures of these nine standard compounds are shown in Figure 1C.

The maximum concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 0.02% was used as a vehicle control. Data represent mean ± SD of three independent experiments. * p < 0.05. EGF, epidermal growth factor.

We next performed an MTT assay to determine the effects of KP extract on cell viability (with or without the presence of EGF). We found that the viability of HeLa cells was decreased when the concentration of KP extract was increased (both without or with the presence of EGF). Therefore, the obtained results exhibited two different ranges of concentration, which are non-cytotoxic and cytotoxic concentration. Data for the MTT viability assay are presented in Figure S1. As we were particularly interested in studying the effects of KP on modulating signal transduction pathways in living cancer cells and based on the fact that cell death can affect the intracellular protein content, we thus selected three different noncytotoxic concentrations (3.75, 7.5, and 15 µg/mL) for all experiments to ensure that the inhibitory effects of KP are not primarily caused by the activation of cell death, which results in protein deconstruction.

IL-6 has been reported to be highly expressed in invasive cervical carcinoma and is associated with the pathogenesis of HPV-related cervical carcinoma [2,30,31]. To determine whether KP can suppress the secretion of IL-6 by HPV18-positive HeLa cells in response to EGF stimulation, we performed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to measure the level of IL-6 in the culture supernatants of HeLa cells either untreated, treated with EGF, or treated with EGF and KP at different nontoxic concentrations for 24 h. The results showed that the basal level of IL-6 in the culture supernatant of the untreated cells was 356.2 ± 19.97 pg/mL (Figure 1D). The addition of EGF to HeLa cells for 24 h resulted in a significant increase in IL-6 secretion in the supernatant to 426.8 ± 12.40 pg/mL (p = 0.0011), meaning that EGF-induced production of IL-6 was increased around 20%, as compared with that of the untreated cells. Interestingly, KP extract showed an inhibitory effect on IL-6 production in response to the influence of EGF, and the reduction of the cytokine was observed to be in a concentration-dependent manner. Specifically, KP extract at 7.5 and 15 µg/mL could significantly reduce IL-6 secretion to 326.8 ± 18.19 and 242.6 ± 13.85 pg/mL, respectively (p < 0.0001), which were both less than the basal level of IL-6 from untreated cells. The dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) vehicle control (0.02%) showed no inhibitory effect on IL-6 secretion (Figure 1D). These results suggest that KP, containing methoxyflavones, could be able to suppress the production and secretion of IL-6 from HeLa cervical cells stimulated with EGF.

2.2. KP Inhibits EGF-Induced STAT3 Activation
On the basis of our observation from ELISA that KP could potently suppress IL-6 levels in the culture supernatants of HeLa cells stimulated with EGF, we tested whether the intracellular production of IL-6 is affected by the action of KP. We thus performed Western blot analysis to detect total IL-6 protein in the cell lysates. The results showed that HeLa cells without any treatment expressed cellular IL-6 (Figure 2A), and the cells responded to EGF stimulation by increasing production of cellular IL-6 by 1.41 ± 0.09 fold. However, in comparison with HeLa cells treated with DMSO in combination with EGF, KP extract at 7.5 and 15 µg/mL could significantly reduce cellular IL-6 production to 0.80 ± 0.04 fold, respectively, whereas DMSO did not have any effect on suppressing EGF-induced cellular IL-6 expression (Figure 2A,B).

The protein expression levels of IL-6, GP130, and Mcl1 were normalized against actin, while the phosphorylated form of STAT3 was normalized against total STAT3 protein. Data represent mean ± SD of three independent experiments. * p < 0.05 in comparison with cells treated with DMSO + EGF.

Because we observed that KP could suppress the influence of EGF on inducing the upregulation of both intracellular and secreted IL-6 in HeLa cells, we further defined whether KP has the ability to regulate the production of other molecular players in IL-6 signaling. We examined GP130, which is one of the earliest molecules responsible for conveying the signal transduction upon IL-6 binding. We demonstrated that the untreated HeLa cells expressed a low basal level of GP130 protein, but EGF could significantly increase GP130 protein production to approximately 10-fold (10.96 ± 0.92 fold; p < 0.0001). Surprisingly, KP strongly reduced EGF-induced expression of this protein at all tested concentrations (3.75, 7.5, and 15 µg/mL) to 3.23 ± 0.95 (p = 0.0228), 3.21 ± 0.57 (p = 0.0113), and 1.76 ± 0.53 (p = 0.0072) fold, respectively, compared with that of cells treated with DMSO + EGF (Figure 2A,C). Additionally, we analyzed another key signaling molecule, STAT3, and found that neither EGF nor KP extract had effects on STAT3 protein levels. Nevertheless, EGF noticeably induced phosphorylation of STAT3 by 2-fold, and KP at all selected concentrations almost completely inhibited EGF-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 with the maximum inhibition observed in cells treated with KP at 15 µg/mL (0.15 ± 0.03 fold; p < 0.0001) in comparison with that of cells treated with DMSO + EGF (Figure 2A,D). Additionally, KP showed strong inhibitory effects over the influence of EGF on the expression level of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 (Figure 2A,E). These data suggest that KP can negatively regulate the expression level and the phosphorylation of important molecular players in the IL-6/STAT3 signal transduction pathway in HeLa cells.

2.3. EGF has no Effects on Nuclear Factor Kappa B (NF-κB) Activation in HeLa Cells, and the Suppression of IL-6 Production by KP is not Regulated through NF-κB Inhibition
It has been reported that the activation of EGFR by EGF in some cancer cell lines results in NF-κB activation. Therefore, to address our hypothesis that EGF may increase the production and secretion of IL-6 in HeLa cells through activating NF-κB, and KP may suppress this effect of EGF, we performed immunofluorescence to detect changes in NF-κB p65 localization after EGF stimulation. NF-κB p65 was detected in the cytoplasm of untreated cells (Figure 3A(a)). Surprisingly, EGF treatment for 15 min did not induce NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation in HeLa cervical cancer cells (Figure 3A(b)). We further incubated cells with EGF for 24 h, but the results were the same, demonstrating that EGF did not induce NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation in HeLa cells (Figure S2). Additionally, HeLa cells treated with KP extract at different concentrations in the presence of EGF showed no difference in NF-κB p65 localization pattern, as compared with cells in the untreated, EGF-treated, and DMSO-treated groups (Figure 3A(c–e)). We further verified NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation by inducing cells with 20 ng/mL of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) for 15 min. The results clearly showed that TNF-α potently induced NF-κB p65 translocation into the nucleus of HeLa cells (Figure 3B(b)) when compared with the cytoplasmic NF-κB localization in untreated cells (Figure 3B(a)). Similarly, KP extracts did not inhibit TNF-α-induced NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation (Figure 3B(c–e)). In addition to NF-κB p65, HeLa cells in all groups were co-stained with Phalloidin-TRITC for visualizing filamentous actin, and the signals in all groups were approximately equal (Figure 3A(f–j) and Figure 3B(f–j)). Our findings clearly indicate that EGF does not induce NF-κB activation, and KP does not have any effect on NF-κB nuclear localization status, which suggests that KP suppresses IL-6 production via targeting other signaling molecules.

Filamentous actin [F-actin (red)] was stained with Phalloidin-TRITC. Micrographs were captured at 40× magnification. Data are representatives of three replicates.

2.4. KP Inhibits EGF-Induced Activation of EGFR
It is well known that EGFR can activate STAT3 phosphorylation. Consistently, our data (shown in Figure 2) depicted the potent ability of KP in inhibiting EGF-induced phosphorylation of STAT3. Therefore, the effects of KP on suppressing the upstream EGFR signal transduction pathways were determined. One possible mechanism by which KP could inhibit the EGFR signal transduction pathway is through downregulation of EGFR protein expression. To test this hypothesis, we performed an immunofluorescence study to visualize the expression of EGFR on the surface of HeLa cells treated with KP extract at different concentrations. We found that the signal intensity of EGFR in HeLa cells treated with KP (at all concentrations) for 24 h (Figure 4A(b–d)) was not different from that seen in the untreated (Figure 4A(a)) and DMSO-treated cells (Figure 4A(e)). Supporting this, the results from the Western blot analysis confirmed that KP extract did not significantly affect the expression levels of cellular EGFR protein (Figure 4B). We further tested our second hypothesis that KP may be able to suppress the activation of EGFR upon EGF stimulation. The results from an immunofluorescence study clearly showed the potent inhibitory effect of KP on EGF-stimulated EGFR activation. In particular, EGF addition markedly activated EGFR phosphorylation at tyrosine 1068 residue (Y1068) (Figure 4C(d–f)) and ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Figure 4D(d–f)). However, KP at 7.5 and 15 µg/mL dramatically reduced EGF-induced stimulation of EGFR and ERK phosphorylation (Figure 4C(g–l) and Figure 4D(g–l), respectively). Consistently, results from the Western blot analysis verified that the presence of KP inhibited EGFR activation upon EGF stimulation. In addition to the phosphorylation of Y1068 (Figure 4E,F), the phosphorylation status of EGFR at tyrosine 1045 (Y1045) was also shown to be decreased in cells treated with KP extract and stimulated with EGF (Figure 4E,G). Moreover, the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was also confirmed to be reduced by the action of KP in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 4E,H). All of these results suggest that KP can suppress EGF-stimulated EGFR activation, which may result in downregulation of IL-6 production in HeLa cells.

2.5. KP Exhibits Anti-Proliferative Effects over EGF Stimulation
On the basis of the fact that EGF stimulates cell growth and survival and is a regulator of cancer cell proliferation, we investigated the expression of Ki-67, a marker for cell proliferation that has been used as a potential prognostic or predictive marker in several malignant tumors. To determine whether KP can reduce EGF-induced cell proliferation, untreated and KP-treated HeLa cells were stained to detect Ki-67 expression. The results showed that all of the untreated cells exhibited a high basal level of Ki-67 protein in the nuclei of HeLa cells, and many cells were observed to be in the late mitotic phase, where the duplication of the nuclei was clearly seen (Figure 5A(a–c)). We observed that during mitotic cell division, the intensity of Ki-67 signal was markedly increased. When EGF was present, all nuclei of HeLa cells showed a remarkable increase in Ki-67 expression, with many mitotic cells detected (Figure 5A(d–f)). Interestingly, when HeLa cells were incubated with EGF in the presence of KP extract at 7.5 µg/mL, we observed a drastic decrease in Ki-67 intensity (Figure 5A(g–i)). When the concentration of KP extract was increased to 15 µg/mL, a substantial reduction in Ki-67 expression was clearly seen (Figure 5A(j–l)). We also observed that some cell nuclei exhibited a very low or undetectable level of Ki-67 (Figure 5A(l), arrow heads). HeLa cells treated with DMSO vehicle plus EGF revealed similar characteristics to those cells in the EGF-treated group (Figure 5A(m–o)). We further performed cell counting at 24, 48, 73, and 96 h after KP treatment and found that KP extract at 15 μg/mL significantly reduced the number of cells at 48 h and 72 h, whereas KP at all concentrations causes the reduction of cell number in a concentration-dependent manner at 96 h (Figure 5B). The inhibitory effects of KP were still seen in the treatment with the presence of EGF, where KP at 15 μg/mL significantly reduced the HeLa cancer cell number at 48, 72, and 96 h (Figure 5C). These data confirm the anti-proliferative effects of KP against EGF-stimulated HeLa cells.

2.6. KP Inhibits IL-6-Induced STAT3 Activation and Expression of the Anti-Apoptotic Protein Mcl-1
Because we observed that KP could significantly reduce the production and secretion of IL-6, as well as the level of GP130 in HeLa cells stimulated with EGF, we further explored whether KP has the ability to suppress IL-6 signaling. On the basis of the fact that classic IL-6 signaling requires binding of IL-6 to the interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) and subsequent activation of STAT3, we performed an immunofluorescence study to determine the effects of KP on STAT3 activation in response to exogenous IL-6 treatment. The results showed that stimulation of HeLa cells with 50 ng/mL of human recombinant IL-6 led to phosphorylation of STAT3 in the nucleus of many cells (Figure 6A(d–f)), but this effect of IL-6 on inducing STAT3 phosphorylation was almost completely inhibited by KP extract at 15 µg/mL (Figure 6A(g–i)). We further verified the inhibitory effects of KP by Western blot analysis, and the results showed that IL-6 at 50 ng/mL induced strong phosphorylation of STAT3 (3.07 ± 0.09 fold; p < 0.0001) (Figure 6B) in the nuclei of HeLa cells. As expected, we observed that KP extract at 3.75, 7.5, and 15 µg/mL significantly suppressed IL-6-induced STAT3 phosphorylation to 1.58 ± 0.09, 0.84 ± 0.11, and 0.40 ± 0.05 fold, respectively, (p < 0.0001) (Figure 6B). Additionally, KP at 15 µg/mL showed significant inhibitory effects over the influence of EGF on the phosphorylation of Akt and the expression level of the anti-apoptotic protein, Mcl-1 (Figure 6B). These results indicate that KP potently inhibits IL-6-induce STAT3 activation and the expression of an anti-apoptotic protein McL-1, suggesting that KP may increase the sensitivity of HPV18 positive cervical cancer cells to cytotoxic standard chemotherapy drugs.

One of the most common neoplastic diseases that affects women worldwide is cervical cancer. This type of cancer has been proven to be associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection [32]. The local immune system of the genital tract is assumed to be responsible for defending against HPV infection and controlling HPV-related cervical cancer. However, cervical cancer development and progression may be related to a persistent immune response and inflammation. This statement can be supported by many epidemiologic studies reporting a strong correlation between chronic inflammation resulting from multiple sexually transmitted pathogens and the development of cervical cancer [33]. IL-6 has been proved to be involved in the proliferation and differentiation of various malignant tumors [34,35]. Considering the link between inflammatory cytokine production and cervical cancer, various cytokines have been implicated in the pathogenesis of cervical cancer, among which IL-6 has received particular attention. An example of this link is shown by a study reporting that consistently higher expression of IL-6 and VEGF is found in cancerous tissues than in the adjacent noncancerous tissues in early-stage cervical cancer patients [36]. Another study by the same research group demonstrated that cervical cancer cells increase IL-6 production, and the overexpression of this cytokine may promote cervical tumorigenesis by activating VEGF-mediated angiogenesis via a STAT3 pathway [37]. There have been attempts to understand the mechanism of IL-6 in promoting cervical cancer development. One study has uncovered that E6 protein produced from HPV 16/18 activates IL-6/STAT3 signaling, which further induces the senescence of cancer-associated fibroblasts, which may remodel the tumor microenvironment to promote cervical epithelial cells from a chronic tumor-prone inflammatory state to malignant proliferation [38]. On the basis of high microenvironmental IL-6 levels promoting cervical cancer development and angiogenesis, inhibition of the biological activity of IL-6 may be potentially beneficial for the treatment of cervical cancer.

We first determined the basal level of IL-6 produced by HeLa cells and found that HeLa cells secreted a high basal level of IL-6 in the serum-free culture supernatant collected after 24 h. The explanation for this phenomenon may be because of the fact that HeLa cervical cancer cells contain HPV-18 sequence, which stimulates constitutive expression of IL-6. Besides cervical cancer cells, the effect of HPV16/18 E6 and E7 on upregulating IL-6 expression has been reported in E6- and E7-transfected A549 cells, which are a non-small cell lung cancer cell line [39]. In addition to viral infection, EGFR has been documented to play a role in increasing IL-6 expression. For example, EGFR activation in response to EGF binding mediates IL-6 production in ovarian and lung cancer cells [40,41]. Moreover, the production of IL-6 has been reported to be regulated at the transcriptional level by the MAPK signal transduction pathway in HeLa cells induced with IL-1β [42]. Therefore, it is possible that EGF can also regulate the production of IL-6 in HPV18 positive cervical cancer cells through induction of similar signaling pathways. The results from our current study showed that the addition of EGF enhanced IL-6 secretion in the culture supernatant of HeLa cells, and that KP extract could significantly reduce the effect of EGF in inducing IL-6 secretion in a concentration-dependent manner. In particular, KP extract at the maximum concentration exhibited a potent inhibitory activity in which IL-6 secretion was reduced to a level lower than that of the untreated cells (without the presence of EGF). Similar results were observed when we lysed HeLa cells and detected the intracellular level of IL-6 protein. These results indicate that KP can interfere with EGFR signaling in stimulating the production and secretion of IL-6, at least in part through inhibiting MAPK activation. Our previous report supports this statement because we clearly demonstrated that KP could potently suppress EGF-induced ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt phosphorylation in HeLa cervical cancer cells and SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells [29,43].

On the basis of the observation that EGF could increase IL-6 production in HeLa cells, it is reasonable to hypothesize that EGF may also induce the expression of other important molecular players in the IL-6/STAT3 signal transduction pathway in HeLa cells. As expected, EGF stimulation for 24 h strongly induced the expression of GP130 protein, which is a signal-transducing subunit shared by the receptors for the IL-6 family of cytokines [44,45,46]. Surprisingly, KP at all tested concentrations was able to suppress EGF-induced GP130 production. These results indicate that KP can mediate the downregulation of GP130, which is important for autocrine signaling in response to IL-6 binding. EGFR is well known to catalyze the phosphorylation of STAT3 in response to EGF [47], and upon activation by EGF, EGFR dimerizes to facilitate cross-phosphorylation of several tyrosine residues, including tyrosine 1068 (Y1068), which is the binding site for STAT3 [48]. We thus examined the effects of KP on suppressing EGF-induced STAT3 activation. We discovered that EGF could induce the phosphorylation of STAT3 in HeLa cervical cancer cells. Our data are in line with previous reports revealing that EGF can cross talk with IL-6/STAT3 signaling in other cell types. For instance, one study showed that STAT3 phosphorylation in response to IL-6 is prolonged by EGF addition [22]. However, HeLa cells stimulated with EGF in the presence of KP showed a drastic reduction in STAT3 phosphorylation. Together, our data confirmed that KP can inhibit IL-6 production and STAT3 activation stimulated by EGF. We also tested the expression level of the anti-apoptotic protein, Mcl-1, which has been reported to be concomitantly expressed with IL-6 in human invasive cervical carcinomas, and Mcl-1 expression has been shown to be induced by IL-6 through the PI3K/Akt pathway [10]. Mcl-1 can be upregulated by trophic factor cytokines including IL-6 [49] and growth factors including EGF [50,51]. Specifically, EGF activates Mcl-1 translation through the RAS–RAF–MEK–ERK and ELK1 pathway. Interestingly, our results demonstrated that KP markedly reduced EGF-induced Mcl-1 production in HeLa cells, confirming its anti-cancer ability to modulate the EGFR/MAPK signaling cascade.

The inducible nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) regulates the expression of a wide variety of genes during inflammatory responses and the initiation and progression of cancer [52,53]. Interestingly, EGF has been demonstrated to stimulate IKK-dependent NF-κB activation via PI3K and protein kinase C, resulting in cell-cycle progression in estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer cells [54]. Specifically, it is well known that NF-kB regulates Mcl-1 and IL-6 expression, and these two proteins are also highly expressed in invasive cervical cancer, but not in normal cervical tissues [10]. On the basis of these previous reports, NF-kB may be involved in EGF-induced IL-6 production in HeLa cervical cancer cells. Therefore, we explored whether KP suppresses EGF-induced production of IL-6 by blocking NF-kB activation. We monitored the activation of NF-kB by performing an immunofluorescence study to visualize its nuclear translocation in response to EGF stimulation. Surprisingly, EGF did not stimulate NF-kB nuclear translocation at any time points in this cell line. Unsurprisingly, KP was observed to have no effect on the localization of NF-kB. To confirm that HeLa cells used in our study remain responsive to inflammatory stimuli, we stimulated the cells with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and found that HeLa cells rapidly responded to TNFα by activating NF-kB nuclear translocation, indicating that the NF-kB signaling pathway is functional in this cell line. However, KP failed to inhibit TNFα-stimulated NF-kB activation. These data indicate that EGF does not play a major role in activating NF-kB to upregulate IL-6, and we could rule out the possibility that KP suppresses the production and secretion of IL-6 in HeLa cells through modulation of the NF-kB signaling pathway. We continued our attempts to understand how KP inhibits EGF-induced IL-6 production in HeLa cells by focusing on the ability of KP to suppress the upstream events of EGFR signaling. One possibility is that KP may downregulate the expression of EGFR. Therefore, we evaluated the expression of EGFR by staining to detect its presence on the surface, as well as by Western blot analysis. However, we observed no significant difference in the level of EGFR, indicating that KP does not suppress the EGF-induced IL-6 production by decreasing the expression of EGFR. As we previously reported that KP suppresses ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation in response to EGF stimulation in HeLa cells [29], it is possible that KP may suppress the activation of EGFR upon EGF binding. As expected, data from an immunofluorescence study showed that KP dramatically inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation at residue 1068 of EGFR, which is a binding site for the GRB2 adaptor protein [55] and STAT3 [48]. The phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was verified to be inhibited by KP in a concentration-dependent manner. The results showed that the inhibitory effects of KP occur at the upstream events of the MAPK signaling pathway. We verified the immunofluorescence results by Western blot analysis and found similar results, whereby KP suppressed phosphorylation of EGFR at both tyrosine 1068 and tyrosine 1045. These results clearly indicate that KP is able to inhibit the activation of EGFR in response to EGF stimulation, which explains why KP can suppress EGF-induced IL-6 production and secretion in HeLa cells. In addition, we designed an experiment to confirm the anti-proliferative effects of KP against EGF stimulation by visualizing the presence of Ki-67 protein in the nuclei of HeLa cells. Ki-67 is a nuclear nonhistone protein [56] that is universally expressed in proliferating cells. Research studies have explored the use of Ki-67, along with other markers, as a potential prognostic or predictive markers in many malignant diseases [57]. As expected, we found that KP reduced the expression of Ki-67 in the nuclei of HeLa cells, with a very low number of mitotic cells detected, whereas EGF-treated cells exhibited high expression of nuclear Ki-67 and a high number of dividing cells. Moreover, we performed additional experiment to evaluate a growth curve of HeLa cells treated with KP with or without the presence of EGF. Data confirmed that KP significantly reduces the cell number over 96 h even when EGF was present. These data verify that KP has effects on HeLa cell proliferation. Consistently, the results support our previous study, wherein we discovered that KP significantly increases the time for cancer cells to migrate to the scratched site, as examined by wound healing assay [29,43]. Altogether, these results strongly suggest that KP suppresses EGF-induced IL-6 production through inhibiting the activation of EGFR and its subsequent proliferative effects. It would significantly help our understanding of the molecular mechanism of action of KP if we knew exactly where the active methoxyflavones of KP interacts with EGFR to abolish receptor activation. The current study did not provide any information on how KP interrupts EGFR signaling at the structural level, as the KP crude extract contains mixed potential active methoxyflavones. However, on the basis of our data, it is possible that KP methoxyflavones may bind to certain domains of EGFR and interfere with the receptor autophosphorylation. This hypothesis can be tested in the future with computational approaches to analyze compound–protein association at the structural and energetic level together with functional tests.

Considering the fact that higher expression of IL-6 is evident in cancerous tissues than in adjacent noncancerous tissues in early-stage cervical cancer patients [36], and our observation that KP decreases EGF-induced IL-6 production and secretion, it is reasonable to imagine that KP may hamper cancer development. One possible hypothesis is that KP may be able to interrupt the IL-6 autocrine machinery. Therefore, we examined whether KP inhibits the effects of exogenous IL-6 on conveying the signal through its receptors. On the basis of one of our interesting observations demonstrating that KP strongly inhibited EGF-induced upregulation of GP130, we anticipated that the reduction of this cytokine receptor subunit would make HeLa cells less responsive to extracellular IL-6. As anticipated, our results clearly showed that KP totally inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation in the nuclei of cells stimulated with human recombinant IL-6. Consistently, we noticed that KP also suppressed Akt phosphorylation upon IL-6 stimulation. On the basis of the previous report that IL-6 induces the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 in cervical cancer cells through a PI3K/Akt-dependent pathway [10], we tested the expression level of Mcl-1 protein and found that KP potently suppressed the IL-6-induced expression of this anti-apoptotic protein in HeLa cells.
The preparation of the plant extract was performed exactly as reported in our previous study [29]. Briefly, rhizomes of KP harvested from the CMU-RSPG Kaempferia housing at Chiang Dao, Chiang Mai Province, Thailand with voucher specimen number, R-CMUKP002, were weighed, chopped, and extracted with 95% ethanol (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) at room temperature (RT) for three days. The ethanolic extract was filtered; concentrated using a rotary evaporator; lyophilized; and kept in an air-tight, light protected container. The KP extract stock solution was freshly prepared using DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) prior to each assay. One gram of ethanolic KP crude extract was dissolved in 1 mL of 100% DMSO to make a stock solution of 1 g/mL, and the stock was pre-diluted in medium prior to each treatment. Each experiment was performed with three independent batches of KP extract, each assayed in triplicate. The final concentration of DMSO was maintained below 0.5% v/v throughout all experiments.
The presence of major methoxyflavones in the KP ethanolic extract was identified by high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) compared with standard compounds. Nine standard compounds, including 3,5,7,3′,4′-pentamethoxyflavone (1), 5,7,4′-trimethoxyflavone (2), 3,5,7-trimethoxyflavone (3), 3,5,7,4′-tetramethoxyflavone (4), 5-hydroxy-3,7,3′,4′-tetramethoxyflavone (5), 5-hydroxy-7-methoxyflavone (6), 5-hydroxy-7,4′-dimethoxyflavone (7), 5-hydroxy-3,7-dimethoxyflavone (8), and 5-hydroxy-3,7,4′-trimethoxyflavone (9), were obtained from the Eco-friendly Product Research laboratory (EfPRL), Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Chiang Mai University, Thailand. The structures of these standard compounds were elucidated using 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, BrÜker DPX 400 spectrometer, (Bruker BioSpin Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA) and confirmed by comparing to the previous literature that identified these compounds in KP [58,59]. HPLC analysis for methoxyflavones in KP extract was performed on an Agilent 1100 series (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a UV/vis detector. The separation was carried out on a C18 column (250 mm × 4.6 mm, internal diameter 5 µm, Hypersil™, Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA). The mobile phase was methanol/0.5% acetic acid (65:35, v/v), operation at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The injection volume was set as 20 µL.
The human HeLa cell line [HeLa 229 (ATCC® CCL-2.1TM)] used in this study was obtained from ATCC (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). The cells were cultured in complete medium, which is Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) and antibiotics (100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin) (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and maintained under a humidified atmosphere of 37 °C, 5% CO2. The cells were sub-cultured every 2–3 days.
The effect of KP on cell viability was evaluated using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) to obtain the range of toxic and nontoxic concentrations. The MTT assay was performed according to a previously published protocol [60]. HeLa cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 1 × 104 cells per well for 24 h in complete medium. Cells were then treated with KP extract at various concentrations (0–1 mg/mL) or with vehicle (DMSO at 0.001%–0.1%) for 48 h, after which cells were exposed to the MTT reagent (0.5 mg/mL in PBS) for 2 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. After aspirating the culture supernatants, 200 μL of DMSO was added to each well, and the plates were incubated in the dark for 10 min. The absorbance at 590 nm was measured using a microplate reader (BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT, USA). The cell viability assay was performed three times, and each assay was undertaken in triplicate (n = 9 in three individual experiments). Data for MTT viability assay are presented in Figure S1. Three different noncytotoxic concentrations (3.75, 7.5, and 15 µg/mL) were selected for all experiments.
HeLa cells were left untreated or treated with different nontoxic concentrations (0–15 μg/mL) of KP with the presence of 100 ng/mL of recombinant human epidermal growth factor (EGF) (Immuno Tools, Friesoythe, Germany) for 24 h. The supernatants of the HeLa cells were harvested and kept at 4 °C until use. The concentration of IL-6 in the culture supernatants was measured by using ELISA MAX™ Deluxe Set Human IL-6 (BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instruction. Briefly, the capture antibody diluted in a coating buffer was added into individual wells of a microtiter plate and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Then, the plate was added with blocking buffer for 1 h, at room temperature (RT). Sample supernatants were added into each well and plates were incubated at RT for 2 h. After washing, a detection antibody solution was added to each well for 1 h. Then, the plate was washed four times before adding a diluted avidin–HRP solution and incubating for 30 min. The signal was developed by the addition of freshly mixed TMB substrate solution. A stop solution was added to each well, and the absorbance was read at 450 nm and 570 nm with a microplate reader (BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT, USA).
For studying the effects of KP on inhibiting EGF-induced expression and phosphorylation of important proteins in IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway, HeLa cells at 90% confluence cultured in 3 cm dishes were treated with KP extract at different concentrations (0–15 μg/mL) in serum-free media with the presence of 100 ng/mL of EGF for 24 h. For studying the effects of KP on total EGFR protein expression, HeLa cells were treated with KP extract at different concentrations (0–15 μg/mL) in serum-free medium (without the presence of any growth factors or cytokines) for 24 h. For studying the effects of KP on suppressing EGFR phosphorylation, HeLa cells were treated with KP at different concentrations (0–15 μg/mL) for 24 h and activated with 100 ng/mL EGF for 2 min before harvesting. For studying the effects of KP on inhibiting IL-6-induced STAT3 signaling, HeLa cells were treated with KP at different concentrations (0–15 μg/mL) in serum-free media in the presence of 50 ng/mL of human recombinant IL-6 for 24 h. After treatment, the culture supernatants were discarded, cells were rinsed with PBS, and cell lysates were prepared by adding 300 μL of 1x reducing Laemmli buffer into the sample dishes. Samples were collected, heated at 95°C for 5 min, separated by SDS-PAGE, and electroblotted onto PVDF membranes (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Marlborough, MA, USA). Membranes were blocked with 5% BSA (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) in TBS-T (0.02 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.0137 M NaCl, and 0.1% (w/v) Tween 20) (all reagents from Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) at RT for 1 h. Membranes were then incubated with an appropriate primary antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, MA, USA) dissolved in 5% BSA in TBS-T at 4°C overnight. Primary antibodies included a 1:1000 dilution of a rabbit anti-IL-6 antibody (catalog number 12153), a rabbit anti-GP130 antibody (catalog number 3732), a mouse anti-STAT3 antibody (catalog number 9139), a rabbit anti-Mcl-1 antibody (catalog number 94296), a rabbit anti-EGFR antibody (catalog number 4267), a phosphospecific rabbit anti-STAT3 (Tyr705) antibody (catalog number 9145), phosphospecific rabbit anti-EGFR antibodies (Tyr1045 (catalog number 2237) and Tyr1068 (catalog number 3777)), a phosphospecific rabbit anti-ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) antibody (catalog number 4370), or a phosphospecific rabbit anti-Akt (Ser473) antibody (catalog number 4060), and a 1:10,000 dilution of a mouse anti-β-actin antibody (catalog number MA1115) (Boster Biological Technology, Pleasanton, CA, USA). After three washes with TBS-T, membranes were washed and incubated with secondary antibodies (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA); an anti-mouse IgG conjugated with IRDye®800CW (catalog number 926-32210) (1:5000) or an anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with IRDye®680RT (catalog number 926-68071) (1:5000) at RT for 2 h. The immunoreactive bands were visualized using an Odyssey ® CLx Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA). The bands were analyzed using Image Studio Lite software.
Immunofluorescence was performed to determine NF-κB nuclear localization (upon EGF and TNF-α (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA) stimulation), EGFR expression and phosphorylation upon EGF stimulation, nuclear Ki-67 protein (antibody catalog number 9129, Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, MA, USA) expression, and STAT3 phosphorylation in the nucleus upon IL-6 stimulation. HeLa cells grown on glass cover slips were treated with KP extract at different concentrations (0–15 μg/mL) for 24 h in serum-free medium. Cells were stimulated with 100 ng/mL of EGF for 2 min (for pEGFR staining), for 15 min (for pERK1/2 staining), with 100 ng/mL of EGF or 20 ng/mL of TNF-α for 15 min (for NF-κB staining) (antibody catalog number 8242, Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, MA, USA), with 100 ng/mL of EGF for 24 h (for Ki-67 staining), or with 50 ng/mL of human IL-6 for 24 h (for pSTAT3 staining). After treatment, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) (dissolved in PBS for 15 min at RT. Cells were then washed three times with PBS for 5 min, each time. Next, cells were permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. The cells were washed three times with PBS and then blocked with 1% bovine serum BSA in PBS for 1 h. Cells were incubated with appropriate primary antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, MA, USA) overnight at 4°C. Primary antibodies included a rabbit anti-EGFR antibody (1:50), a rabbit anti-NF-κB antibody (1:400), a rabbit anti-Ki-67 antibody (1:400), a phosphospecific rabbit anti-EGFR (Tyr1068) antibody (1:800), a phosphospecific rabbit anti-ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) antibody (1:200), and a phosphospecific rabbit anti-STAT3 (Tyr705) antibody (1:100). Cells were washed three times and incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies (a 1:500 dilution of Alexa488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, Alexa594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, or Alexa488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) plus 10 µg/mL of Hoechst 33342 (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) (for nuclear staining) for 2 h, in the dark, at RT. In some experiments, Phalloidin-TRITC (1:5000) (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) was used to visualize filamentous actin (F-actin) (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA). After washing three times with PBS (5 min each) and one time with distilled water (5 min), sample cover slips were mounted with Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL USA). Observations were performed on a fluorescence microscope, AX70 Olympus R, Japan, with 40× magnification, and micrographs were captured with the DP-BSW Basic Software for the DP71 microscope digital camera.
HeLa cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 2.5 × 104 cells/well in complete media and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Cells were then treated with KP extract at various concentrations (0, 3.75, 7.5, and 15 µg/mL), with or without the presence of EGF at 100 ng/mL. The total number of cells were counted using a haemacytometer at different time points which were at 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h. Three individual experiments were performed, with three replicates for each experiment.
Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Data are presented as mean ± SD. In all analyses, a p-value (p < 0.05) was considered as statistically significant.
We previously reported that KP is able to suppress growth and survival signal transduction pathways in HeLa cervical cancer cells. However, many aspects related to the anti-cancer properties of KP remain largely unexplored. Recently, accumulated evidence has elucidated the roles of the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in the pathogenesis of HPV-positive cervical cancers. Our current study shows that KP extract can suppress the cellular expression and secretion of IL-6 protein and STAT3 activation in HeLa cells induced by EGF. The suppression of EGF-induced IL-6 production has been proven to be caused, at least in part, by the ability of KP to inhibit the phosphorylation of the EGF receptor. Consistent with the finding that KP can suppress EGFR activation, KP has been proven to possess anti-proliferative properties against HeLa cervical cancer cells. In contrast, EGF does not activate NF-κB signaling, and KP has no effect on the activation status of NF-κB, ruling out the possibility that KP decreases IL-6 production via suppressing NF-κB activation. Finally, we add additional information that KP can also inhibit autocrine IL-6 signaling, which is a key process of tumorigenesis.

It has been previously demonstrated that copper-based metal−organic frameworks (MOFs) accelerate formation of the therapeutically active molecule nitric oxide (NO) from S-nitrosothiols (RSNOs). Because RSNOs are naturally present in blood, this function is hypothesized to permit the controlled production of NO through use of MOF-based blood-contacting materials. The practical implementation of MOFs in this application typically requires incorporation within a polymer support, yet this immobilization has been shown to impair the ability of the MOF to interact with the NO-forming RSNO substrate. Here, the water-stable, copper-based MOF H3[(Cu4Cl)3-(BTTri)8] (H3BTTri = 1,3,5-tris(1H-1,2,3-triazol-5-yl)benzene), or Cu-BTTri, was incorporated within the naturally derived polysaccharide chitosan to form membranes that were evaluated for their ability to enhance NO generation from the RSNO S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO). This is the first report to evaluate MOF-induced NO release from GSNO, the most abundant small-molecule RSNO. At a 20 μM initial GSNO concentration (pH 7.4 phosphate buffered saline, 37 °C), chitosan/Cu-BTTri membranes induced the release of 97 ± 3% of theoretical NO within approximately 4 h, corresponding to a 65-fold increase over the baseline thermal decomposition of GSNO. Furthermore, incorporation of Cu-BTTri within hydrophilic chitosan did not impair the activity of the MOF, unlike earlier efforts using hydrophobic polyurethane or poly(vinyl chloride). The reuse of the membranes continued to enhance NO production from GSNO in subsequent experiments, suggesting the potential for continued use. Additionally, the major organic product of Cu-BTTri-promoted GSNO decomposition was identified as oxidized glutathione via mass spectrometry, confirming prior hypotheses. Structural analysis by pXRD and assessment of copper leaching by ICP-AES indicated that Cu-BTTri retains crystallinity and exhibits no significant degradation following exposure to GSNO. Taken together, these findings provide insight into the function and utility of polymer/Cu-BTTri systems and may support the development of future MOF-based biomaterials.

Metal−organic frameworks (MOFs) are crystalline structures consisting of organic linkers bound to metal centers, producing highly porous lattices that are frequently utilized in gas storage and heterogeneous catalysis, among other applications.1 It has been previously reported by Harding et al. that copper-based MOFs may be capable of inducing the nitric oxide (NO)-forming decomposition of S-nitrosothiols (RSNOs), a class of NO-donating compounds that are unique in their biological occurrence.2 NO itself is produced endogenously by a family of NO synthase enzymes, where it contributes to the immune response, neurotransmission, and regulation of vascular tone.3 Biological NO production is essential to the wound-healing process, and exogenous NO supplementation has been shown to promote accelerated wound closure.4–6 These properties have led to the exploitation of copper-based MOFs for their ability to induce the release of NO directly from RSNOs. Biological RSNOs are believed to function collectively as a physiological reservoir of NO, most commonly in the form of S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) and S-nitrosoalbumin, which exist in blood in the nM to μM range.7,8 Biologically relevant GSNO and other RSNO species have been established to produce NO through thermal decomposition or photolysis that leads to the formation of disulfide, according to the equation 2RSNO → 2NO + RSSR.9 In addition to these reaction pathways, it has been shown that exposure to copper ions induces the catalytic, NO-forming decomposition of many RSNOs.10 This phenomenon has led to the development of copper-based materials intended to produce a localized supply of NO through the controlled decomposition of bioavailable RSNOs, typically through inclusion of simple copper salts or complexes.11,12

The ability of copper-based MOFs to promote NO release from RSNOs is exemplified by the decomposition of S-nitrosocysteine and S-nitrosocysteamine by copper benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate (HKUST-1) under nonaqueous conditions.2,13 It was later discovered that the triazolate-bridged framework (Figure 1a) derived from reaction of 1,3,5-tris(1H-1,2,3-triazol-5-yl)benzene (H3BTTri) with CuCl2·H2O in DMF (H3[(Cu4Cl)3−(BTTri)8], or Cu-BTTri) exhibits a similar ability to promote the decomposition of both S-nitrosocysteamine and S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) under aqueous, physiological conditions and exhibits an exceptional degree of aqueous stability.14,15 For this reason, Cu-BTTri represents a useful candidate for the development of MOF-based biomaterials that are intended to trigger NO release from RSNOs in a physiological environment. However, the feasibility of utilizing copper-based MOFs for this application depends on their effective incorporation within a supporting polymeric matrix and the retention of useful activity thereafter. Consequently, the identification of polymers that allow the productive, NO-forming interaction between aqueous-phase RSNOs and Cu-BTTri is a prerequisite to biological implementation. Nevertheless, previous work has been confined to hydrophobic polymers that are unlikely to permit the rapid diffusion of polar (and potentially charged) RSNO substrates. For this reason, hydrophilic materials such as polysaccharides may represent a useful alternative.

Chitosan is a versatile, naturally derived polysaccharide consisting of β-(1,4)-linked glucosamine and N-acetyl glucosamine units (Figure 1b). Because chitosan is biodegradable, typically regarded as nontoxic, and exhibits important therapeutic properties, it has been widely utilized for biomedical applications ranging from drug delivery to tissue engineering.16 The conversion of chitosan to water-soluble polycationic salts or other easily processed derivatives permits the preparation of films, fibers, hydrogels, and other materials with useful characteristics.17 As a biomaterial, chitosan has been reported to exhibit inherent bacteriostatic/antimicrobial properties, in addition to well-characterized hemostatic properties that have resulted in its commercial adoption for the treatment of hemorrhagic injuries.18 Furthermore, numerous studies have shown that chitosan-based wound dressings can significantly accelerate the wound healing process.19,20 Notably, both the wound-healing and antimicrobial properties of chitosan overlap significantly with those of NO, suggesting the possibility for combined action. Due to the potential for NO and chitosan to exhibit synergistic effects as a therapeutic, multiple publications have reported the development of NO-releasing materials based on chitosan. NO-releasing chitosan derivatives have been proposed as potential candidate polymers for the development of wound-healing dressings, while NO-releasing chitosan oligosaccharides have been utilized as solution-phase antibacterial agents.21–23 These previous examples of NO-releasing chitosan derivatives have been universally prepared through the inclusion of unstable synthetic NO-donor species that release a finite quantity of NO through irreversible decomposition processes. In wound dressings, this may produce complications arising from both storage limitations and toxicity concerns.24 For these reasons, an alternative method of producing localized NO release is desirable. In the case of potential blood-contacting materials, this goal may be achieved through the recruitment of natural RSNOs.25,26

Herein, the concept of promoting accelerated NO release from naturally occurring GSNO using chitosan membranes containing water-stable Cu-BTTri was investigated. This work represents the first inclusion of a water-stable MOF within chitosan and expands the potential biological utility of Cu-BTTri blends to nonsynthetic polymers. Cu-BTTri was incorporated within a chitosan matrix and characterized by pXRD, ATR-FTIR, and SEM. The chitosan/Cu-BTTri membranes were subsequently exposed to GSNO at physiological temperature and pH, and chemiluminescence-based NO detection was utilized to confirm that the MOF retained its ability to accelerate the NO-forming decomposition of the RSNO substrate. Confinement of Cu-BTTri within the polysaccharide was not observed to significantly impact the enhanced NO generation observed when unbound Cu-BTTri particles were tested separately with GSNO. Additionally, mass spectrometry was used to qualitatively determine the major product of the MOF-promoted decomposition of GSNO as oxidized glutathione (GSSG). Although it is known that thermal or photolytic RSNO decomposition typically results in the formation of the corresponding disulfide dimer (2RSNO → 2NO + RSSR), this is the first report to definitively identify the production of disulfide from an RSNO by Cu-BTTri.27 These findings reveal that Cu-BTTri may be successfully immobilized within chitosan membranes without impairment of its ability to induce NO release from GSNO, providing further insight into the function of such MOF/polymer systems. The ability of Cu-BTTri to generate an enhanced level of NO release from GSNO complements the existing therapeutic uses of chitosan, particularly in the realm of future wound-healing applications. While previous reports have examined promotion of NO release from putatively endogenous S-nitrosocysteine, this structure primarily occurs in the form of S-nitrosated cysteine residues in biological macromolecules, which may limit the ability of a MOF to interact with the RSNO and induce NO release.26 Similar efforts have been constrained to S-nitrosocysteamine and SNAP, which are not known to occur biologically. This work is the first to expand the substrate scope to include GSNO, a biologically available RSNO identified in human blood. Furthermore, the use of water-stable and potentially reusable Cu-BTTri and naturally derived chitosan represents a new and potentially more environmentally benign approach to achieving NO release from RSNOs compared to previous systems based on synthetic polymers.

All materials were used as received without any further purification.
Powder X-ray diffraction (pXRD) measurements and ATR-FTIR were used to examine the incorporation of Cu-BTTri within chitosan. All pXRD measurements were made using a Bruker D-8 Discover DaVinci X-ray diffractometer (Cu Kα X-ray source, line focus) (Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA). A 0.6 mm divergent slit was placed on the primary beam side and a high-resolution energy-dispersive LYNXEYE-XE-T detector on the diffracted beam side during the XRD studies. XRD measurements were performed with Soller slits on the primary and diffracted beam side (2.5° separation). The instrument alignment was tested using the NIST 1976b SRM. All measurements were performed at 4−50θ with a step count of 1.0. ATR-FTIR spectra were obtained in the range of 600−4000 cm−1 on a Nicolet 6700 FTIR spectrometer equipped with a Smart iTR ATR sampling module and ZnSe crystal plate (Thermo Electron Corporation, Madison, WI, USA). Images of chitosan/ Cu-BTTri membranes were acquired using a JEOL JSM-6500F scanning electron microscope with an accelerating voltage of 10.0 kV and a working distance of 10.0 mm (JEOL USA Inc., MA, USA). All samples were placed under vacuum and coated with 20 nm of gold prior to runs. Images were taken at magnifications of 250×, 1000×, 2000×, and 3000×. All data were processed using TEAM Software. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed under nitrogen on a TA Instruments Q500 thermogravimetric analyzer at a rate of 5 °C/min from 25 to 500 °C (New Castle, DE, USA), and data were processed using TA Instruments Universal Analysis 2000.
1,3,5-Tris(1H-1,2,3-triazol-5-yl)-benzene (H3BTTri) was synthesized following the method reported by Demessence et al. and suspended (225 mg) in 10 mL of DMF.28 This mixture was treated with 0.1 M hydrochloric acid to dissolve the triazole, and then copper(II) chloride dihydrate (383 mg) was added to the solution. After thorough agitation to ensure dissolution of all solids, the mixture was heated at 100 °C for 3 d to form Cu-BTTri-DMF as a dark violet precipitate. Cu-BTTri-DMF was isolated by centrifugation and washed with DMF and Millipore water, then heated in water at 80 °C for 3 d to produce Cu-BTTri-H2O as a light purple solid. This solid was isolated by centrifugation, dried, and subsequently characterized by ATR-FTIR and pXRD.

Preparation of Chitosan Membranes.
Chitosan (2.5 g) was dissolved in 100 mL of 1% acetic acid, and the resulting water-soluble chitosan acetate was isolated by lyophilization. To prepare chitosan membranes, chitosan acetate (180 mg) was dissolved in 6 mL of Millipore water, followed by the addition of Cu-BTTri-H2O (20 mg) to form a suspension. This mixture was allowed to air-dry within a PTFE mold, and the prepared film was treated twice with 100 mL of 250 mM pH 8.0 sodium phosphate buffer to produce a flexible hydrated sheet. This material was washed with 5 × 100 mL of Millipore water and subsequently punched into smaller 13 mm diameter membranes. Chitosan control membranes were prepared without Cu-BTTri-H2O, following an otherwise identical procedure.

Synthesis of GSNO.
GSNO was prepared using a protocol adapted from a previously reported synthesis.29 1.53 g of glutathione was suspended in 8 mL of water at 0 °C, followed by the addition of 2.5 mL of 2 M hydrochloric acid and 0.345 g of sodium nitrite. This mixture was stirred at 0 °C for 40 min, and then the precipitated solid was isolated by filtration and washed with ice-cold water, acetone, and diethyl ether. The resulting light pink powder was placed under vacuum to remove residual solvent and stored at −20 °C in the absence of light. Subsequent to synthesis, an aqueous solution of GSNO was analyzed by ICP-AES, where no copper was detected. UV−vis: λ 335 (π → π*), 545 nm (nN → π*).
Water swelling of chitosan and chitosan/Cu-BTTri membranes was determined gravimetrically by obtaining their dry masses (Wd), followed by immersion in Millipore water for 24 h. Samples were then withdrawn and reweighed (Ww) after the removal of excess water. The following calculation was then applied to determine the overall water uptake and swelling ratio of each sample.30

Measurement of NO Formation.
NO release measurements were obtained using Sievers chemiluminescence-based nitric oxide analyzers (NOA 280i, GE Analytical, Boulder, CO, USA). Calibration was performed with ultrahigh purity nitrogen (0 ppm of NO) and 45 ppm of NO/nitrogen. Prior to use, dry membranes were immersed in Millipore water overnight to produce 13 mm diameter hydrated membranes. In each experiment, a single chitosan/Cu-BTTri (n ≥ 3) or chitosan control (n ≥ 3) membrane was suspended in 5 mL of deoxygenated PBS (pH 7.4) in a custom analysis cell connected directly to an NO analyzer under a constant flow/purge of nitrogen gas and protected from exposure to light. Baseline was acquired for several minutes, and then an aqueous GSNO solution was injected into the cell to produce an initial concentration of 20 μM. After GSNO injection, each experiment was allowed to continue until NO detection returned to the baseline level. As an additional control, the NO release profile from the decomposition of GSNO in the absence of membranes was also obtained. In all cases, gas phase NO concentration (ppb/ppm) was used to determine total NO release (mol) using an instrument-specific calibration constant obtained from the reduction of sodium nitrite. Following each experiment, the membrane was removed and the buffer solution was analyzed for copper content using ICP-AES. To evaluate reuse of the chitosan/Cu-BTTri membranes, each previously tested membrane was resuspended in Millipore water overnight and the previously described experimental procedure was repeated.

Mass Spectrometry Analysis.
The products formed following exposure of Cu-BTTri to GSNO were determined by suspension of approximately 20 mg of chitosan/Cu-BTTri membrane in a 1 mM solution of GSNO/Millipore water. The experiment was protected from light and maintained at 37 °C until disappearance of the characteristic red/pink color of GSNO. A control experiment was similarly conducted using chitosan membrane without Cu-BTTri (intended to reflect thermal decomposition of GSNO), while a second control experiment involved exposure of GSNO to 365 nm UV light using a 100 W Blak-Ray B-100AP UV lamp (UVP, Upland, CA, USA). The solutions were subsequently analyzed using an Agilent 6224 LC−MS (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). The instrument was equipped with an Agilent multimode ionization (MMI) source capable of electrospray ionization (ESI) and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI). For all the performed analyses, ESI in positive polarity was employed with the mass measurement range set at 70−3200 m/z. The sample solutions were introduced into the ion source using flow injection at a flow rate of 0.22 mL/min via the ESI nebulizer using a mobile phase consisting of 80/20 water/acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid. The ion source conditions were as follows: capillary voltage, 3000 V; fragmentor voltage, 200 V; skimmer voltage, 60 V; drying gas temperature, 310 °C; drying gas flow-rate (nitrogen gas), 10 L/min; and nebulizer pressure, 45 psi. All collected data were analyzed with Agilent MassHunter Qualitative Analysis software (B.07.00).

3.1. Synthesis and Characterization of Cu-BTTri and Chitosan/Cu-BTTri Composite Materials.
Chitosan-based biomaterials have been shown to accelerate the wound healing process, resulting in significant overlap with the wound-healing properties of NO. Although previous reports have examined the inclusion of NO donor moieties within chitosan, this report is the first to evaluate an alternative approach involving the incorporation of Cu-BTTri, a copper-based MOF that has demonstrated the ability to promote release of NO from endogenous RSNOs. As previously described by Demessence et al., the cubic sodalite framework of Cu-BTTri consists of [Cu4Cl]7+ square planar units bound to BTTri3− ligands. Within this structure, each triazolate ligand interacts with six distinct copper sites in [Cu4Cl]7+ units. This fundamental building unit is depicted in Figure 1a. Interactions between the triazolate ligands and copper produce an increase in metal−ligand bond strength, conferring greater water stability in comparison to many copper carboxylate based structures.

To prepare chitosan/Cu-BTTri membranes, water-soluble chitosan acetate was dissolved in Millipore water and Cu-BTTri was blended into the mixture to produce membranes containing 10% w/w MOF (Figure 2). The polysaccharide was deprotonated and rendered insoluble by treatment with 250 mM pH 8 phosphate buffer, resulting in 13 mm diameter circular chitosan membranes containing 295 ± 8 nmol of Cu mg−1 (11% w/w Cu-BTTri), as determined by dissolution and subsequent copper determination via ICP-AES. While aqueous sodium hydroxide is typically utilized to cure chitosan membranes, it was observed that treatment of Cu-BTTri with concentrated base had an adverse effect on the integrity of the MOF.31 Similarly, immersion of chitosan acetate/Cu-BTTri membranes in 10% sodium hydroxide produces a visual color change (dark violet to blue) and the loss of Cu-BTTri diffraction peaks when examined by pXRD. In order to ensure preservation of the MOF, comparatively mild pH 8 phosphate buffer was used as an alternative method of neutralizing the membranes. To isolate the effect of Cu-BTTri in subsequent analyses, control membranes were prepared without addition of the MOF. Both chitosan/Cu-BTTri and chitosan control membranes were characterized by ATR-FTIR, pXRD, and SEM. IR absorptions characteristic of chitosan are present in the control membranes, including the broad hydroxyl O−H stretch feature occupying the region of 3650−3000 cm−1 (Figure 3a). This feature overlaps with the bands associated with the C2 primary amine, and both asymmetric and symmetric N−H stretching modes are identifiable at 3355 and 3278 cm−1. Additional diagnostic bands are observed at 2849 (C−H stretch), 1636 (amide I), 1577 (amide II), 1056, and 1025 (C−O stretch). These typical features are accompanied by new absorptions at 2917 (acetate CH3), 1542 (acetate salt), and 1258 cm−1 (phosphate), arising from preparation of the membrane. Incorporation of Cu-BTTri produces additional features characteristic of the MOF at 1617 (C=C stretch), 830, and 775 cm−1 (C−H out-of-plane bend). Furthermore, finished membranes exhibited the major pXRD diffraction peaks associated with Cu-BTTri (Figure 3b). The pXRD spectrum in conjuction with ATR-IR data indicates that the MOF is indeed present and has retained crystallinity after incorporation into the chitosan membrane.

Imaging of the membranes by SEM showed clear incorporation of Cu-BTTri within the chitosan matrix (Figure 4c–f) with distinct crystals observed at the membrane surface. In Figure 4b, the distribution of Cu-BTTri at the surface of the membrane is shown. At greater magnification, the octahedral morphology of Cu-BTTri was evident, and the crystals displayed an apparent trimodal particle size distribution with an overall range of 1−15 μm (Figure 4e,f). The materials were further evaluated for overall copper distribution by SEM-EDX using a copper analysis probe. Figure 4e and Figure 4f depict the copper overlay on the SEM image of the chitosan/Cu-BTTri membrane. As can be observed, the overall distribution of copper is concentrated in regions that contain Cu-BTTri. Cross-sectional SEM images of nonhydrated chitosan/Cu-BTTri membrane indicated a thickness of 150 μm (Figure 4 g). Additionally, SEM-EDS was performed on the cross-section to assess Cu-BTTri particle distribution throughout the bulk of the membrane (Figure 4g,h). This analysis showed copper distributed within the membrane, with greater concentration in regions of noticeable particle agglomeration (Figure S1 in Supporting Information). Taken together, these findings suggest dispersion of Cu-BTTri throughout the entire membrane, with certain areas of higher concentration indicative of Cu-BTTri agglomeration following incorporation within the polymer matrix.32

Additionally, the water swelling ratio of each material was determined gravimetrically after 24 h of immersion to assess if incorporation of Cu-BTTri into the chitosan membrane produced changes to the ability of the polymer to uptake water. Chitosan/Cu-BTTri membranes exhibited 244 ± 26% swelling, while chitosan control membranes swelled by 240 ± 26%. These results suggest that incorporation of Cu-BTTri does not have a significant impact on the ultimate water uptake of the chitosan materials. The stability of both the chitosan membrane and incorporated Cu-BTTri at pH 8 was established by characterization carried out subsequent to a preparatory step performed in pH 8 phosphate buffer (Figure 3b). Behavior of the membrane under other pH conditions was assessed by immersing the materials in Millipore water and adjusting the pH with dilute hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. The stability of the membrane when directly exposed to either 1 M hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide was also examined. Immersion in 1 M hydrochloric acid produced rapid decolorization and deterioration of the membrane, resulting from both the dissolution of chitosan and digestion of the MOF. At pH 4−5, the membrane exhibited swelling and a change in appearance consistent with the early stages of dissolution. This outcome was anticipated from the known solubility of chitosan following protonation in hydrochloric acid. Despite the onset of polymer dissolution, pXRD of the membrane indicated that Cu-BTTri remained intact under mildly acidic conditions (Figure S2e,f). At pH values of 6 and 9, the membrane retained a normal appearance and did not exhibit signs of swelling or deterioration. Subsequent pXRD characterization supported the survival of the MOF within this pH range, as well (Figure S2g,h). Immersion of the membrane in 1 M NaOH resulted in a pronounced color change from dark violet (imparted by Cu-BTTri) to blue and associated loss of the MOF diffraction pattern (Figure S2i). To examine the ability of the chitosan/Cu-BTTri membrane to tolerate biological media, samples of the material were immersed in both whole blood and platelet-rich plasma for 2 h, followed by rinsing with water. The stability of the MOF was then evaluated by pXRD, which showed the retention of all major diffraction peaks (Figure S2c,d). Analysis of chitosan/Cu-BTTri membrane by TGA yielded an onset decomposition temperature of 232 ± 0.12 °C, a value that was consistent with the decomposition of chitosan alone (Figure S3). In general, Cu-BTTri membrane appeared to demonstrate appropriate chemical and thermal stability for potential use in biomedical applications, where extreme pH or temperature conditions are not anticipated.
As previously noted, NO exhibits numerous beneficial properties, including the ability to accelerate healing when delivered to the site of an injury.4–6 It was reasoned that the ability of Cu-BTTri to significantly enhance the rate of NO release from biologically relevant RSNOs could potentially permit the conscription of these endogenous species as useful sources of NO. The retention of this function when incorporated within a chitosan membrane may allow for the future development of blood-contacting materials exhibiting both the desirable antimicrobial and wound-healing effects of chitosan, as well as the ability to generate enhanced levels of therapeutic NO from endogenous sources. To assess the ability of chitosan/Cu-BTTri membranes to generate NO from physiologically relevant GSNO, membranes were swelled in Millipore water (18.2 MΩ·cm) and subsequently immersed in pH 7.4 10 mM phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at 37 °C inside custom gas-flow analysis cells connected to Sievers chemiluminescence-based NO analyzers (NOA 280i). The effect of chitosan/Cu-BTTri membranes on NO formation from GSNO was evaluated through the addition of 100 nmol of GSNO to the analysis cell (sufficient to produce a 20 μM initial concentration), and the resulting gas-phase NO concentration (ppb) was recorded under nitrogen atmosphere until reaching baseline levels (n ≥ 3) (Figure 5). Subsequently, a predetermined NO calibration constant (mol of NO ppb−1 s−1) was used to determine the overall NO release (mol). Control experiments (n ≥ 3) were performed using GSNO alone, chitosan membranes without incorporated Cu-BTTri, and Cu-BTTri in free particulate form (equivalent to the mass incorporated within chitosan/Cu-BTTri membranes). In all cases, experiments were protected from light to avoid photolytic decomposition of GSNO. At the end of experiments involving chitosan/Cu-BTTri membranes, the reaction medium was exposed to light to test for the presence of residual, nondecomposed GSNO.

When GSNO was added to analysis cells containing chitosan/Cu-BTTri membranes, a noticeable increase in NO generation was observed in comparison to the behavior of GSNO alone (Figure 6a). In the presence of chitosan/ Cu-BTTri membranes, NO generation was found to continuously increase over the duration of the experiment until depletion of the available GSNO after approximately 4 h (Figure 6a). In contrast, the decomposition and corresponding NO release of GSNO alone remained steady over the same interval, indicating the clear role of chitosan/Cu-BTTri membranes in promoting NO formation from the RSNO substrate. Chitosan/Cu-BTTri membranes induce a mean release of 97 ± 3 nmol of NO (mean ± SD) over 4.3 ± 0.3 h, resulting in 97% recovery of total theoretical NO (Figure 6b, Table 1). Comparatively, GSNO decomposition in the absence of chitosan/Cu-BTTri membranes resulted in the recovery of 1.5 ± 0.7 nmol of NO (1.5% of theoretical) over the same mean interval (Figure 6b, Table 1). In order to provide support that membrane-enhanced NO generation was primarily attributable to the inclusion of Cu-BTTri, chitosan membranes without incorporated MOF were assessed, and a moderate increase in GSNO decomposition(9.8 ± 0.3 nmol of NO, 9.8% of theoretical) was observed (Figure 6b, Table 1). This elevation was constant and did not result in the distinctive NO release profile produced by Cu-BTTri/membranes and may be attributable to the presence of trace metal ions chelated by the chitosan matrix (e.g., Fe2+), which have been previously demonstrated to enhance NO generation.33,34 Overall, it was observed that chitosan/Cu-BTTri membranes are capable of producing a 65-fold increase in NO generation over the baseline thermal decomposition of GSNO, with a significantly smaller 7-fold elevation observed for chitosan control membranes.

After the chitosan/Cu-BTTri membranes were demonstrated to successfully enhance NO generation from GSNO, they were reused to produce NO from subsequent additions of GSNO (up to 3 additional times). Following initial experiments, the membranes were removed from the reaction medium and suspended in Millipore water for 1 d. The NO generation experiment was then repeated as described previously (3 times), with a consistent quantitative NO recovery (Table 2). This result suggests that the chitosan/Cu-BTTri membranes possess the capability for reuse, potentially indicating the ability to continuously generate NO from endogenous GSNO. This property may reduce concerns related to the finite loading currently associated with many NO-releasing polymeric materials.

3.3. Impact of Cu-BTTri Immobilization on Enhancement of NO Generation.
To evaluate the effect of Cu-BTTri immobilization within chitosan on the activity of the MOF, the ability of free Cu-BTTri particles to decompose GSNO was examined for comparison. Cu-BTTri particles were found to promote the release of 97 ± 6 nmol of NO (97% of theoretical) over 5.0 ± 1.6 h, indicating the absence of a statistical difference between the performance of chitosan/Cu-BTTri membranes and free Cu-BTTri particles (Figure 6a and Figure 6b, Table 1). In contrast, it was previously shown that incorporation of Cu-BTTri within a biomedical grade polyurethane resulted in an 8-fold reduction in the activity of Cu-BTTri.14 Additionally, Cu-BTTri particles incorporated into poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) were shown to require 10 h to reach a steady rate of NO release in the presence of SNAP.15 These observed differences in NO generation may be attributable to the restricted ability of RSNO to diffuse through hydrophobic polymer matrices, inhibiting interaction with incorporated Cu-BTTri.15,35 This hypothesis is supported by the calculated swelling ratio of 244% for chitosan/ Cu-BTTri membranes, indicating significant uptake of water, while PVC and polyurethane compositions exhibit weight increases from water uptake ranging from 0.02% to 20%.36–38 Since hydrophilic chitosan membranes readily swell in the presence of water, this process may encourage uptake and diffusion of GSNO, permitting more rapid interaction with the MOF. It was also observed that Cu-BTTri particles showed wider variability in the overall time required to fully decompose GSNO, which ranged from 3 to 7 h. This variability may be due to random particle agglomeration resulting in decreased access to Cu-BTTri active sites, while immobilization of the MOF within the chitosan membrane limits this outcome. Because incorporation of Cu-BTTri within chitosan reduces variability in reaction time, it allows for increased control of NO generation from GSNO. For this reason, further understanding of these types of MOF/polymer composite systems may provide valuable insight into the tunability of such materials for future applications.

3.4. Evaluation of Structural Integrity and Copper Leaching.
Following NO release experiments with GSNO, the chitosan/Cu-BTTri membranes were analyzed by pXRD to ensure that they remained structurally intact following NO generation. The observed pXRD pattern retained all major diffraction peaks corresponding to Cu-BTTri, supporting that the MOF remains intact over the course of the experiment (Figure 6c). Furthermore, the buffer solutions remaining at the end of each experiment were subjected to copper content determination by ICP-AES after the removal of the chitosan/ Cu-BTTri material. This analysis tests for the presence of copper that may have been released by deterioration of the MOF or detachment of fine MOF particles. Results indicated that (1.5 ± 1.1) × 10−9 mol of copper was present in solution following exposure to GSNO during NO release experiments, corresponding to 0.10 ± 0.07% of theoretical (based on the mass of incorporated Cu-BTTri) and resulting in a mean copper concentration of approximately 3 × 10−7 M. This lack of significant copper leaching was particularly encouraging due to the fact that solution-phase glutathione (the parent thiol of GSNO) is an established copper chelator.39

GSNO decomposition experiments performed in the presence of copper(II) chloride at a concentration of 3 × 10−7 M did not result in a greater rate of NO production, as evaluated by chemiluminescence-based detection. This outcome reduces the likelihood that dissolved copper ions contribute to the acceleration of the NO-forming decomposition of GSNO and is consistent with reports from Williams et al., where higher copper concentrations of 10−6 M were needed to initiate decomposition.9 Over a total of three subsequent cycles (each performed in quadruplicate), a mean copper quantity of (5.2 ± 3.5) × 10−9 mol of copper was found in solution (corresponding to 0.3 ± 0.2% of theoretical), with individual cycles varying from (1.9 ± 0.3) × 10−9 to (8.8 ± 9.6) × 10−9 mol. These values were not found to statistically differ from the amount of copper determined in the original experiment and generally indicate that loss of copper from the membranes remains low. To contrast potential MOF-related copper leaching from chitosan/Cu-BTTri membranes with that from copper(II) ions directly chelated to chitosan, 13 mm chitosan membranes were exposed to copper(II) chloride to prepare additional control materials containing an average of 300 nmol of Cu mg−1. These membranes were exposed to GSNO as described in previous experiments, and the buffer solution was subsequently tested for copper content. Notably, the NO-forming reaction completed within 0.68 ± 0.08 h and resulted in the recovery of 86 ± 6 of theoretical NO, indicating a significantly faster rate of GSNO decomposition. More importantly, ICP-AES was used to determine a solution-phase copper content equivalent to 3.6 ± 0.8% of theoretical, indicating up to 36-fold greater leaching than in the case of chitosan/Cu-BTTri membranes.

Previous publications have described the incorporation of copper nanoparticles or copper complexes within polymers to produce materials capable of promoting NO release from RSNOs. These approaches often rely upon the deliberate generation of copper ions or use of labile complexes that readily release copper ions into solution.40,41 In one significant report, Hwang et al. covalently attached copper(II)−cyclen complexes to biomedical polymers and evaluated these materials for their ability to induce NO-forming RSNO decomposition.42 In this example, copper leaching as high as 25% was observed, which may limit applicability due to toxicity concerns. In comparison, the substantially lower copper leaching observed for chitosan/ CuBTTri membrane suggests greater retention of copper attributable to the stability of the MOF. In the case of potential biological applications, this lower level of copper leaching may reduce concerns related to copper toxicity.43

3.5. Determination of Reaction Products.
To complement data supporting the preservation of Cu-BTTri following NO release experiments with chitosan/Cu-BTTri membranes, an additional experiment was performed in which chitosan/ Cu-BTTri membrane was exposed to a higher 1 mM concentration of GSNO in Millipore water at 37 °C. This solution was subsequently analyzed via mass spectrometry to screen for evidence of Cu-BTTri degradation, which was anticipated to regenerate the triazole ligand H3BTTri. This compound was not detected in solution following the experiment, supporting the lack of MOF degradation. The thermal decomposition of GSNO in the presence of chitosan membrane (without incorporated Cu-BTTri) and the UV-initiated decomposition of GSNO in the absence of any polysaccharide were carried out for comparative purposes. In all cases, GSSG (C20H32N6O12S2) was identified as the major organic decomposition product of GSNO (Table 3, Scheme 1). In comparative experiments performed using chitosan membrane at 37 °C or GSNO alone in the presence of UV light, the formation of GSSG was anticipated by the equation 2RSNO → 2NO + RSSR, which describes the decomposition of RSNO to form the corresponding disulfide dimer.9 In the case of chitosan/Cu-BTTri membranes, the identification of GSSG provides new evidence that the end products of the MOF-accelerated reaction are consistent with the decomposition under thermal or UV-mediated conditions. In general, the mass spectra resulting from analysis of GSNO decomposition solutions containing either chitosan/ Cu-BTTri or chitosan membranes were consistent with one another, while the GSNO solution exposed to UV light (without the presence of any material) predictably did not exhibit the peaks associated with the polysaccharide (e.g., monomeric glucosamine or N-acetylglucosamine).

In the case of thermal or UV-induced decomposition, NO-forming homolytic cleavage of the S−N bond is believed to be followed by the combination of thiyl radicals to form disulfide.9 It has been observed that dissolved copper ions are capable of catalyzing NO release from RSNOs, with five- and six-membered copper chelates described as potential mechanistic intermediates.44 Previous reports examining the use of copper-based MOFs for the generation of NO from RSNOs have suggested that the MOF behaves similarly to copper ions by reduction of the copper(II) sites to copper(I), producing both NO and disulfide (Scheme 1).9,27,44 However, it has not been previously verified that Cu-BTTri (or any MOF) forms products consistent with those generated in other known decomposition pathways. In this study, it is shown that the formation of GSSG accompanies the accelerated NO release from GSNO in the presence of chitosan/Cu-BTTri membranes, indicating that the ultimate fate of GSNO remains the same when decomposed by the MOF. While the overall mechanism remains unknown, it has been argued that steric considerations prevent the formation of the ring intermediates often invoked in the case of dissolved copper ions. For certain systems, it has been proposed that MOF copper sites may act as Lewis acids that facilitate the formation of NO from RSNOs.45 A computational study carried out by Li et al. suggests that free copper ions interact with an initial RSNO molecule in solution to form a Cu−S bond, accompanied by the release of NO. This process is repeated with a second RSNO molecule to form a CH3S−Cu−SCH3+ species, which subsequently leads to disulfide formation and regeneration of the copper species. Comparison of this solution-phase scenario to the MOF Cu-BTC indicated that the approach of the initial RSNO molecule was nearly isoenergetic with free copper, but the addition of a subsequent RSNO molecule to the same copper site or adjacent copper sites displayed a higher energy barrier. This suggests that this particular reaction would only be plausible for a flexible MOF that could allow for distortion around the copper center to accommodate the additional RSNO molecule.46 Regardless of actual mechanism, the identification of GSSG is a crucial step toward understanding the interaction of copper-based MOFs with RSNOs.
These findings demonstrate the ability of chitosan/Cu-BTTri membranes to generate an enhanced level of NO release from GSNO, a compound that occurs naturally in blood as a hypothesized NO storage and transport agent. Preservation of Cu-BTTri following incorporation within chitosan was verified by pXRD and ATR-FTIR, and SEM revealed the clear distribution of octahedral Cu-BTTri crystals on the surface of the material. In the presence of 20 μM (100 nmol total) GSNO at physiological temperature and pH, chitosan/Cu-BTTri membranes produced 97 ± 3 nmol over 4.3 ± 0.3 h, representing a 65-fold increase in NO generation relative to the baseline thermal decomposition of GSNO. Under otherwise identical conditions, Cu-BTTri powder (without immobilization in chitosan) produced 97 ± 6 nmol NO over 5.0 ± 1.6 h, indicating no significant difference in performance compared to chitosan/Cu-BTTri membranes. While Cu-BTTri has been previously shown to induce the accelerated decomposition of synthetic RSNOs such as S-nitrosocysteamine and SNAP, this is the first extension of that function to GSNO. Furthermore, inclusion of Cu-BTTri within chitosan membranes did not result in a significant impairment of function, contrasting with earlier polyurethane and PVC-based systems, where polymeric incorporation diminished the activity of the MOF. Following initial experiments, chitosan/Cu-BTTri membranes were capable of promoting accelerated NO release for at least three additional cycles. Characterization by pXRD and SEM subsequent to GSNO exposure supported the lack of extensive Cu-BTTri decomposition, and this outcome was corroborated by the low level of copper leaching as determined by ICP-AES. Moreover, mass spectrometry was used to identify GSSG as the major product of GSNO decomposition in the presence of chitosan/Cu-BTTri, substantiating the hypothesis that disulfides are formed from RSNOs by copper-based MOFs. Taken together, this work indicates that chitosan-based materials incorporating Cu-BTTri may be capable of inducing NO formation from endogenous GSNO in the blood. Examining the assembly and properties of these and similar materials facilitates the use of MOFs for localized NO release, further expanding their potential applications.

Resveratrol, a naturally occurring polyphenol found in some fruits and especially in grapes, has been reported to provide diverse health benefits. Resveratrol’s mechanism of action is the subject of many investigations, and some studies using the ratiometric calcium indicator Fura-2 suggest that it modulates cellular calcium responses. In the current study, contradictory cellular calcium responses to resveratrol applied at concentrations exceeding 10 μM were observed during in vitro imaging studies depending on the calcium indicator used, with Fura-2 indicating an increase in intracellular calcium while Fluo-4 and the calcium biosensor YC3.60 indicated no response. When cells loaded with Fura-2 were treated with 100 μM resveratrol, excitation at 340 nm resulted in a large intensity increase at 510 nm, but the expected concurrent decline with 380 nm excitation was not observed. Pre-treatment of cells with the calcium chelator BAPTA-AM did not prevent a rise in the 340/380 ratio when resveratrol was present, but it did prevent an increase in 340/380 when ATP was applied, suggesting that the resveratrol response was an artifact. Cautious data interpretation is recommended from imaging experiments using Fura-2 concurrently with resveratrol in calcium imaging experiments.

Resveratrol (3,4′,5-trihydroxystilbene) is a naturally occurring polyphenol that is produced in grapes, peanuts, and other food crops, and has been proposed to protect against a variety of aging-related diseases including cardiovascular disease, cancer, neurogenerative disease, and type 2 diabetes [1,2]. The mechanism of action of this compound has been the subject of intensive research. Resveratrol was reported to directly inhibit cAMP-specific phosphodiesterases [3], alter voltage-gated calcium current [4], and modulate store operated calcium entry [5,6]. Uncertainty remains about whether resveratrol initially elicits calcium or cAMP signals, and if these secondary signal responses are similar in all cell types or are cell-type specific.

Calcium is an essential second-messenger signal in all cell types, influencing a wide variety of cellular processes. Calcium signaling is accomplished by the fine control of intracellular calcium concentration gradients [7]. These calcium gradients and their shifts can be visualized using indicator dyes or genetically coded biosensors that bind Ca2+ specifically [8–10]. Intracellular calcium concentration changes at the nanomolar scale can be detected in live cells with either dyes or biosensors.

Fura-2 is a fluorescent ratiometric dye that is widely considered the standard for quantitative intracellular calcium measurements [11]. The peak absorbance shifts from 340 nm when bound to Ca2+, to 380 nm when it is not bound, and it fluoresces maximally at approximately 510 nm when excited at either wave length. The typical procedure for in vitro imaging experiments using Fura-2 involves incubating cells with a 1 – 5 μM solution of the acetoxy-methyl ester form of the dye, which is membrane-permeable, at 37°C for 15–30 minutes. Dye enters the cells and the acetoxy-methyl ester side chain is then cleaved by the cellular non-specific esterase activity, trapping the dye in the cells [8].

Investigations into calcium signaling induced by resveratrol application using Fura-2 have suggested that resveratrol causes release of intracellular calcium stores [12] [5,13–15]. The current study was initiated to determine how resveratrol affects calcium signaling in human epithelial breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231). Initial experiments with Fura-2 suggested that resveratrol caused a dose-dependent increase in intracellular calcium. However, unusual responses observed using Fura-2 caused concern about the reliability of the data. The overall hypothesis for the experiments reported here is that in vitro calcium measurements made with Fura-2 dye are biased by the presence of resveratrol at 10 μM or higher concentration.
MDA-MB-231 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin G and streptomycin sulfate. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were plated on sterile glass 25 mm diameter cover slips in 6-well plates the day before imaging.

The majority of experiments reported here were completed with calcium indicator dyes, but some experiments used calcium biosensor YC3.60 [16] as an alternative. YC3.60 was introduced into MDA-MB-231 by adenovirus transduction. Cells were grown to approximately 80% confluence on 25-mm glass cover slips as described above. Growth medium was removed and replaced with DMEM supplemented with 2% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and Adenovirus YC3.60 using a multiplicity of infection of 500. Cells were incubated for approximately 4 hours with the virus before it was removed and replaced with the 10% FBS growth medium described above. Transduced cells were grown for approximately 48 hrs prior to use in imaging experiments
In experiments with Fura-2, cells were loaded with 1 μM Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes Inc.) by incubating for 15 min at 37°C and 5% CO2 in Krebs Ringers Bicarbonate HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) supplemented with 10 mM D-(+)-glucose (KRBH10) and 0.015% Pluronic F127 (Molecular Probes Inc). Fluo-4 (Molecular Probes Inc.) was substituted for Fura-2 in tests with that indicator. In some experiments, cells were incubated with 10 μM BAPTA-AM (Molecular Probes Inc.) for 15 minutes in KRBH10 plus 0.015% Pluronic F127 at 37°C and 5% CO2, followed by removal of the BAPTA-AM loading solution, and cells were loaded with Fura-2 as above.

Cover slips were placed in a 37°C microperifusion chamber mounted on the specimen stage of an inverted fluorescence microscope. Cells were continuously superfused with KRBH10 (4 ml/min) at 37°C and treatments, including resveratrol (R5010, Sigma, St. Louis, MO), were introduced through the perfusion system. Experiments with Fura-2 were completed with an Olympus IX81 inverted microscope (Olympus America, Center Valley, PA, USA). Fura-2 dual excitation and emission was accomplished using 340- and 380-nm excitation filters and a 510 nm emission filter, and cells were visualized with an Olympus UPlan FLN 40X 1.3 NA oil immersion objective. Light was supplied by a Lambda XL (Sutter Instrument Company, Novato, CA, USA) using a variable aperture to achieve 65–75% attenuation. Digital images (25–50 ms exposure) were recorded with a Hamamatsu EM charge-coupled device camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan) at 10 second intervals.

Cells that were loaded with Fluo-4 or expressed YC3.60 were visualized on a Nikon TE-2000U inverted microscope. Fluo-4 excitation (470 nm) and emission (525 nm) was accomplished with a GFP cube (Chroma Technologies) and cells were visualized with a Nikon Plan Fluor 20X objective. Cells expressing FRET biosensor YC3.60 were visualized as described previously [17] with minor deviations. A Nikon Super Fluor 40X 1.30 NA oil immersion objective was used with 90% light attenuation by neutral density filters. Excitation was at 440 nm and dual emission ratio imaging at 485 and 535 nm was accomplished with a high speed filter wheel (Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA). An Xcite 120 light source (EXFO Life Science Industries, Mississauga, ON, Canada) was used for Fluo-4 and YC3.60 experiments. Digital images (200–250 ms exposure) were captured with a 16-bit Cascade 650 digital camera (Roper Instruments) at 10-s intervals.

Imaging data acquisition and analyses on both microscope systems were accomplished using MetaFluor software (Universal Imaging Corp) and OriginPro 7E (OriginLab Corp.). Emission intensities were background subtracted. Fura-2 data are expressed as the ratio of 340/380 normalized to average resting values in the 60 seconds prior to the application of the first experimental treatment. Data from YC3.60 experiments are expressed as the fold-change in ratio of FRET acceptor and donor emission (535/485 nm ratio) normalized to resting values. Fluo-4 data are expressed as fold-change in emission intensity relative to resting values. All experiments were replicated at least twice, and means and standard errors were calculated using pooled data from relevant experiments.
MDA-MB-231 cells loaded with Fura-2-AM showed an apparent increase in the 340/380 ratio when treated with 100 μM resveratrol, suggesting a rise in intracellular calcium concentration (Figure 1a). However, review of the intensities of the individual 340 and 380 nm traces shows a rise with excitation at 340 nm upon resveratrol introduction but no corresponding decline with excitation at 380 nm (Figure 1b). Similarly, resveratrol applied at 10 and 1 μM caused increases in the 340/380 ratios, but individual traces of 340 nm and 380 nm revealed intensity increases with 340 nm excitation without the expected concurrent declines at 380 nm (Figures 1a, 1c–d).

Note the increase in intensity upon resveratrol addition with excitation at 340 nm but no concurrent decline at 380 nm.

Tests with agonists known to cause store-release and store operated calcium entry showed the expected Fura-2 response. Application of 100 μM ATP caused a large increase in the 340/380 ratio (Figure 2a). The individual plots of 340 and 380 for the ATP response showed an increase at 340 and a concomitant decline in 380 (Figure 2b). Similarly, application of 50 μM ionomycin, a calcium ionophore, resulted in a large increase in 340/380 ratio, and the individual 340 and 380 traces showed the expected large increase at 340 and concurrent decline at 380 (Figure 2c and Figure 2d). These data indicate a normal response by Fura-2 to increases in cytosolic Ca2+ elicited by ATP and ionomycin, but resveratrol caused a response that is not characteristic for calcium binding with Fura-2.

MDA-MB-231 cells loaded with Fluo-4 and then treated with 100 μM resveratrol followed by 100 μM ATP showed no response to resveratrol, but a large response to ATP (Figure 3a). Similarly, MDA-MB-231 cells expressing the cytosolic calcium indicator YC 3.60 that were treated with 100 μM resveratrol followed by a subsequent application of 100 μM ATP showed no response to the resveratrol but a large increase in FRET ratio due to ATP application (Figure 3b). Collectively, these data demonstrate that the Fluo-4 dye and YC 3.60 calcium biosensor in MDA-MB-231 cells were capable of responding to an agonist that is known to increase cytosolic calcium, but no response to 100 μM resveratrol application was detected by these calcium indicators.

When cells were incubated with BAPTA-AM and Fura-2-AM followed by treatment with 100 μM resveratrol, a large increase in 340/380 ratio was observed (Figure 4a). Cells treated with only Fura-2 and 100 μM resveratrol showed an increase in 340/380 ratio that was slightly larger than the BAPTA-treated cells (Figure 4a). Area under the curve calculations indicated that BAPTA treatment reduced the magnitude of the resveratrol response by approximately 29% compared with cells incubated with only Fura-2-AM and 100 μM resveratrol (Figure 4b). However, MDA-MB-231 cells incubated with BAPTA-AM and Fura-2-AM and then treated with 100 μM ATP exhibited a large reduction in 340/380 ratio compared with cells incubated with only Fura-2-AM (Figure 4a). The reduction in area under the curve for the ATP response due to BAPTA-AM treatment was approximately 97% (Figure 4b).

Effect of 10 μM BAPTA pretreatment on intracellular calcium response in MDA-MB-231 cells loaded with Fura-2 and treated with 100 μM ATP or 100 μM resveratrol. a. Pretreatment with 10 μM BAPTA prevented an increase in the 340/380 ratio relative to cells loaded only with Fura-2 upon application of 100 μM ATP. BAPTA reduced the increase in 340/380 ratio upon 100 μM resveratrol application, but the reduction was much less compared with the effect of BAPTA on the ATP response. b. Area under the curve for the graphs shown in Fig 4a. Statistically significant (p<0.003) differences were detected between BAPTA-treated and control cells for both ATP and resveratrol application. Measurements were completed on a minimum of 50 cells in two independent experiments. *, p<0.001; **, p=0.003.
Our data provide strong evidence that resveratrol at concentrations exceeding 10 μM in an imaging buffer interferes with the function of Fura-2-AM dye used in in vitro calcium imaging experiments. Normally, an increase in cytoplasmic calcium in Fura-2-loaded cells causes an increase in the emission at 510 nm upon excitation at 340 nm and a concomitant decline in the 510 emission with 380 nm excitation [8]. The typical decline in the 510 emission upon excitation at 380 does not occur in the presence of high concentrations of resveratrol, and even 1 μM of resveratrol caused a small 340 response but no 380 response. The abnormal 380 excitation response was the initial evidence that caused our laboratory to question data being generated which indicated a strong, rapid, and easily reversible calcium response elicited by resveratrol.

Agreement of the Fluo-4 and YC3.60 calcium indicators in their lack of response to resveratrol application, combined with the abnormal 380 excitation response by Fura-2 in the presence of resveratrol, suggests that the apparent increase in cytosolic calcium elicited by resveratrol in Fura-2 experiments may in fact be experimental artifact. Fluo-4 is a calcium indicator with excitation and emission peaks at 488 and 520 nm, respectively [18]. YC3.60 is a FRET-based genetically encoded cameleon biosensor targeted to the cytosol, with excitation at 440 nm and emission peaks at 485 and 535 nm [16]. These indicators function in very different ways from Fura-2 and from each other and there is no evidence that they functioned abnormally in these experiments. The observation that cells loaded with Fluo-4 could respond to ATP after resveratrol treatment suggests that the resveratrol did not modify the function of Fluo-4. Similarly, the observation that cells expressing YC3.60 responded to ATP after exposure to resveratrol suggests that the biosensor function was not impaired by resveratrol.

BAPTA-AM incubation prior to Fura-2 loading prevented intracellular calcium release due to ATP addition as expected, but it did not prevent a rise in the 340/380 ratio when resveratrol was applied. The observation that cells treated with BAPTA-AM did not respond to ATP, a known agonist of store depletion and store operated calcium entry, suggests that BAPTA-AM was functioning as expected. Failure of BAPTA-AM to prevent an increase in the 340/380 ratio with resveratrol suggests the possibility of an interaction between resveratrol and Fura-2 that causes fluorescence upon 340 excitation, and this fluorescence is not associated with an increase in cytosolic calcium concentration.

The current study does not support the results of several reports in the literature involving Fura-2 calcium imaging measurements when resveratrol was present an imaging buffer. Several reports in the literature describe imaging experiments using Fura-2 with resveratrol at concentrations exceeding 10 mM [12,14,15,19,20]. The failure of BAPTA-AM treatment to prevent an increase in the 340/380 ratio upon resveratrol addition in the current study contradicts the report of Sareen et al. (2007). Explaining the discrepancies between the current study and several literature reports is difficult since independent 340 and 380 traces were not reported in other studies and there are many differences in experimental protocols among the studies. Altered performance of Fura-2 in the presence of resveratrol at concentrations greater than 10 μM was reported previously [5], suggesting that results of the current study are not unprecedented.

Our laboratory no longer uses Fura-2 in the presence of resveratrol at concentrations of 10 μM or higher, but it is uncertain if results reported here can be generalized. All of our experiments were completed with a single source of resveratrol and the same imaging buffer. We completed tests with Fura-2 and resveratrol on our Nikon instrument and achieved the same result as on our Olympus system (data not shown). We recommend that investigators use caution when interpreting data from imaging studies using buffers containing both Fura-2 and resveratrol at concentrations exceeding 10 μM.

Wogonin is a plant monoflavonoid which has been reported to inhibit cell growth and/or induce apoptosis in various tumors. The present study examined the apoptosis-inducing activity and underlying mechanism of action of wogonin in A549 cells. The results showed that wogonin was a potent inhibitor of the viability of A549 cells. Apoptotic protein changes detected after exposure to wogonin included decreased XIAP and Mcl-1 expression, increased cleaved-PARP expression and increased release of AIF and cytotchrome C. Western blot analysis showed that the activity of c-Myc/Skp2 and HDAC1/HDAC2 pathways, which play important roles in tumor progress, was decreased. Quantitative PCR identified increased levels of c-Myc mRNA and decreased levels of its protein. Protein levels of Fbw7α, GSK3β and Thr58-Myc, which are involved in c-Myc ubiquitin-dependent degradation, were also analyzed. After exposure to wogonin, Fbw7α and GSK3β expression decreased and Thr58-Myc expression increased. However, MG132 was unable to prevent c-Myc degradation. The present results suggest that wogonin has multiple anti-cancer effects associated with degradation of c-Myc, SKP2, HDAC1 and HDAC2. Its ability to induce apoptosis independently of Fbw7α suggests a possible use in drug-resistance cancer related to Fbw7 deficiency. Further studies are needed to determine which pathways are related to c-Myc and Fbw7α reversal and whether Thr58 phosphorylation of c-Myc is dependent on GSK3β.
Despite of the large number of clinical trials aimed at improving patient survival, lung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide in both men and women. Approximately 85% of all lung cancer cases are categorized as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which is typically diagnosed at advanced stages [1]. Lung adenocarcinoma, the predominant histological subtype of NSCLC, accounts for 20 to 30% of primary lung cancer cases among subjects under 45 years of age, regardless of smoking history [2]. Most cases of NSCLC are unsuitable for surgery and chemotherapy remains the cornerstone of treatment for advanced disease.

Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are enzymes that remove histone acetylation products. This process compacts the structure of chromatin and represses transcription [3]. HDACs act on various nonhistone protein substrates which play a role in the regulation of gene expression, cell proliferation, cell migration, cell death and angiogenesis [4]. Data from preclinical studies have demonstrated that naturally occurring and synthetic histone deacetylase inhibitors have potent anticancer activity.

HDAC1 and HDAC2 belong to the Class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) family. In vivo, these enzymes form complexes with Sin3, NuRD and Co-REST [5]. HDAC1 and HDAC2 also bind directly to DNA binding proteins such as YY1, Rb binding protein-1 and Sp1 [5].

c-Myc is a transcription factor that is responsible for regulating an array of genes involved in cellular proliferation, growth, apoptosis and differentiation [6]. Deregulated c-Myc expression is observed in roughly 70% of all human tumors [10]. c-Myc expression is regulated by gene transcription, and is dependent on mRNA stability and posttranslational control of protein stability [7]–[9].

Posttranslational regulation of c-Myc can be mediated by Skp2 (S-phase kinase-associated protein 2) and Fbw7(F-box and WD repeat domain-containing 7) [11]. Skp2 and Fbw7 are two different recognition subunits of the SCF-type E3 ligase (SCF, Skp1/Cullin/F-box protein complexes) that recognize specific substrates for proteasomal degradation. Regulation of c-Myc involves phosphorylation of c-Myc at Thr58, resulting in Fbw7-mediated proteasomal degradation. Glycogen synthase kinase 3β(GSK3β) is the only kinase known to phosphorylate c-Myc at Thr58 [24].

Skp2 is a promising target for restricting cancer stem cell and cancer progression [12], it’s overexpression is frequently observed in human cancer and it may, therefore, act as an oncogene. In support of this hypothesis, Skp2 has been shown to recognize Cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitors and tumor suppressive proteins such as p27 Kip1 (Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B), p57 Kip2 (Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1C), p130 (130 kDa retinoblastoma-associated protein) and Tob1 (transducer of ERBB-2 1), but not c-Myc [13]–[16]. Skp2-mediated formation of ubiquitin from c-Myc occurs independently of phosphorylation [25].

Fbw7 deficiency is thought to be involved in drug resistance in human cancers [22], [23]. It has been shown to be inactivated by mutation, deletion, or promoter hypermethylation in breast cancer [17], [18], colon cancer [19], [20], and leukemia [21]. Fbw7 is expressed as three different isoforms (designated α, β, and γ) respectively located in the α-nucleus, β-cytoplasm, and γ-nucleolus [26], [27]. As there are no antibodies for these three isoforms we used the best described and longest of the three isoforms Fbw7α, in our experiments with wogonin.

Wogonin (5, 7-dihydroxy-8-methoxyflavanon) is a naturally monoflavonoid extracted from Scutellaria baicalensis radix [28] that has been recognized as an anticancer drug candidate with potentially low toxicity [29]. The anticancer activity of wogonin has been reported various human cell lines including myeloma cell RPMI 8226 [30], hepatocellular carcinoma SK-HEP-1 [31] and SMMC-7721 [32], glioma cancer cells [33], nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells [34], human breast cancer cells [35], [36] and human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells [37]. Its activity is mediated by the induction of apoptosis and cell differentiation, and is regulated by various genes and proteins [38]–[41].

In this study, we evaluated the effects of wogonin on cell viability and apoptosis in the human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cell line A549. We also assessed the regulation and function of c-Myc/Skp2/Fbw7α and HDAC1/HDAC2 pathways involved in its apoptotic effect.
Reagents and Antibodies
Wogonin was purchased from Guangzhou IDC (China) and MG132 (carbobenzoxy-Leu-Leu-leucinal) was obtained from (Beyotime, China). The following antibodies were used: Fbw7(Cdc4, H-300) and p-c-Myc (Thr 58) (Santa Cruz, USA); c-Myc, GSK3β, AIF (apoptosis inducing factor, Proteintech Group, Inc., USA); HDAC1, HDAC2, Skp2, Survivin, Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2), β-Actin (Boster, China); Mcl-1 (myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1), XIAP(X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein, Bioss, China); Cytochome c (KeyGEN, China); PARP (poly ADP-ribose polymerase, Sino Biological Inc., China).

Cell Culture
The human pulmonary adenocarcinoma cell line A549 was obtained from the Cell Bank of the Animal Experiment Center, North School Region, Sun Yat-Sen University. The cells used in the experiments were maintained in our laboratory in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sijiqing, China) at 37°C and 5% CO2.

Methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium Bromide (MTT) Cell Vaibility Assay
Cells harvested with trypsin were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 1×104 per well. After overnight incubation, the culture medium was removed and the cells were incubated with different concentrations of wogonin. After exposure to wogonin for 24, 48 or 72 h the cells were incubated with MTT at 37°C for an additional 4 h. This allowed mitochondrial dehydrogenase to convert MTT into insoluble formazan crystals. The culture medium was then discarded, and 100 µL of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) was added to each well to dissolve the formazan crystals. The absorption of solubilized formazan was measured at 490 nm using a EL340 microplate reader (Bio-Tek. Instruments, Winooske, VT).

Nuclear Staining
A549 cells were stained with a DAPI (4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining kit (KeyGEN, China). After exposure to graded concentrations of wogonin for 48 h, the cells were washed and incubated with a DAPI working solution (1–2 µg/mL) for 15 min at 37°C. The cells were then rinsed with methanol and Buffer A (60% glycerol in 10 mM phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH7.6)) was added to the suspension. A549 cells were viewed using an Eclipse Ti Nikon microscope (Nikon, Japan).

Mitochondrial Membrane Potential
The mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) of A549 cells was measured usimg a fluorescent, lipophilic, cationic probe, JC-1 (Beyotime, China), according to the manufacturer’s directions. Briefly, cells exposed to wogonin were incubated with 1X JC-1 staining solution for 20 min at 37°C. They were then rinsed twice with JC-1 staining buffer and images were taken with an Eclipse Ti Nikon microscope (Nikon, Japan).

Apoptosis Assay
Cells were labeled with FITC-labeled Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) using an Annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit (KeyGEN BioTECH, China), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, after 48 h exposure to different concentrations of wogonin, the cells were washed with cold PBS and resuspended in 1X binding buffer. Aliquots of 105 cells were mixed with 5 µL of Annexin V-FITC and 5 µL of PI for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. Fluorescence (530 nm) was detected by flow cytometry (FACS Aria, BD Biosciences, USA) within 1 h.

Real-time PCR Analysis
Quantitative RT-PCR was undertaken using a SYBR Green reporter. A549 cells exposed to wogonin were washed with PBS and total RNA was purified by using RNAiso Plus (TAKARA, Japan). The resultant RNA was first reverse transcribed into cDNA using a PrimeScript® RT Master Mix kit (TAKARA, Japan). Gene-specific primers were combined with SYBR® Premix Ex Taq™ (TAKARA, Japan) and amplified using an ABI 7500 real-time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems, USA). All qPCR reactions were performed independently on five samples. The relative mRNA expression was calculated using the 2−ΔΔCt method. The primer sequences used are listed in Table 1.

Western Blot Analysis
Cells washed with PBS were lysed with RIPA (50 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, sodium orthovanadate, sodium fluoride, EDTA and leupeptin, (Beyotime, China) supplemented with protease inhibitor PMSF (Beyotime, China). Cytoplasmic proteins were extracted using a Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Protein Extraction Kit (KeyGEN BioTECH, China).

The soluble protein concentration was determined with a BCA protein assay kit (Beyotime, China). The cell lysates were boiled for 5 min in loading buffer and separated on an SDS-PAGE gel. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore, USA). The membranes were blocked with nonfat milk, probed with various primary antibodies and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies, and visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection reagents (Beyotime, China).

Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses was undertaken using SPSS version 17.0 software. Results are expressed as means and standard errors (Mean ± SEM) from at least three independent experiments. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine statistical significance between groups. Values of P<0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Wogonin Inhibits Cell Viability and Induces Cell Apoptosis
Cell viability was assessed using an MTT assay in association with DAPI staining and flow cytometric analysis after exposure to different concentrations of wogonin. MTT analysis indicated that wogonin inhibited cell viability in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). This was confirmed by results of flow cytometric analysis using AnnexinV-PI (Fig. 1C).

The bars represent the mean values ± SEM (n = 3). (C) Apoptosis assessed by Annexin V/PI staining in A549 cells. Cells were incubated with wogonin at concentrations of 0, 15, 25, 35 µg/mL, for 24 h, 48 h and 72 h. (D) Nuclei stained by DAPI and observed by fluorescence microscope. Apoptotic cells are indicated by arrows. *P<0.05 vs control group, **P<0.01 vs control group.

Compared with the control group, the rate of both early and late stage apoptosis increased after exposure to all concentrations of wogonin. The total apoptosis rate exceeded 50% in the 35 µg/mL group.

DAPI staining (Fig. 1D) identified condensed and cleaved nuclei in cells exposed to 35 µg/mL wogonin, while only clear nuclei with pale blue staining were observed in the control group.

As shown in Fig. 2A, Wogonin was associated with a dose-dependent decrease in mitochondria potential (Δψm) which resulted in decreased red fluorescence (JC-1 polymer) and increased of green fluorescence (JC-1 monomer). This may have been related to down-regulation of Mcl-1 as there was no obvious decrease in Bcl-2 levels. Wogonin also promoted the release of AIF and cytochrome C into the cytoplasm providing further evidence of mitochondrial damage (Fig. 2C). Down-regulation of XIAP, survivin, and of cleaved fragments from PARP indicated that the process of apoptosis continued after mitochondria damage (Fig. 2B).

Wogonin Down-regulates HDAC1 and HDAC2 at Both mRNA and Protein Levels
Protein levels of HDAC1 and HDAC2 were down-regulated in a dose-dependent manner after exposure to different concentrations of wogonin for 48 h (Fig. 3B). This result is consistent with the down-regulation of mRNA detected by qPCR showing that HDAC1 was decreased by 0.69-fold and HDAC2 by 0.73-fold, (uncertainties related to fold-changes were <2) (Fig. 3A). These changes may result in a proportional increase in histone acetylation and promote the expression of tumor suppressive proteins.

Wogonin Down-regulates c-Myc and Skp2 at the Protein Level, and Increases the mRNA Level of c-Myc
Both c-Myc and Skp2 were down-regulated at the protein level following exposure to wogonin (0, 15, 25, 35 µg/mL) for 48 h, (Fig. 4B). As shown in Fig. 4A, the mRNA level of Skp2 decreased 0.81-fold, whereas the mRNA level of c-Myc increased approximately 1.6-fold (uncertainties related to fold-changes both <2). These findings indicate that a proteasomal degradation pathway may be involved in the regulation of c-Myc and Skp2. However, as wogonin resulted in decreased protein expression in Skp2, further experiments focused on the proteasome recognition subunit, Fbw7α, which targets c-Myc.

Wogonin Decreased Fbw7α and GSK3β, and Increased Thr58-Myc at the Protein Level
Protein levels of Fbw7α decreased following exposure to wogonin, (Fig. 5B), but there was no corresponding decrease in mRNA expression (Fig. 5A). Thr58 phophorylation of c-Myc increased (Fig. 5B). Thr58 phophorylation of c-Myc is a required component of its degradation and is mediated by GSK3β. However, GSK3β expression decreased at both the mRNA (0.78-fold at 35 µg/mL) (Fig. 5A) and protein level (Fig. 5B). These findings suggest that phophorylation of c-Myc at Thr58 may occur independently of GSK3β. However, this requires further study.

In these experiments, 1 µM MG132 was added incubated with or without 25 µg/mL wogonin for 48 h. *P<0.05 vs control group, **P<0.01 vs control group.

Experiments were conducted with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 to further understand the proteasomal degradation pathway involved in the regulation of c-Myc. The results in Fig. 5C show that MG132 was unable to reverse c-Myc degradation induced by 25 µg/mL wogonin. Further research is therefore needed to define the exact pathway involved in c-Myc degradation.
Wogonin is a naturally occurring monoflavonoid extracted from Scutellaria baicalensis radix [28]. It has been reported to have antineoplastic activity in various types of cancer by the induction of apoptosis and cell differentiation [30]–[37], and to be regulated by various genes and proteins [38]–[41]. It is known that the c-Myc/Skp2/Fbw7α and HDAC1/HDAC2 pathways, are associated with tumor progression. Here we investigate their role in the anticancer effects of wogonin in NSCLC A549 cells.

We first evaluated the anti-viability and apoptotic effects of wogonin using MTT and Annexin V-PI double staining assays. Our results indicated that wogonin caused dose-dependent and time-dependent inhibition of cell viability (IC50<35 µg/mL at 48 h). The early increase in apoptosis rate in response to wogonin occurred in parallel, with Annexin V-positive cells gradually becoming Annexin-V negative.

At the IC50 (35 µg/mL) cells showed evidence of marked apoptosis, consistent with the nuclear morphology changes seen with DAPI staining.

The expression of apoptosis related proteins, such as Bcl-2, Mcl-1, PARP, XIAP, Survivin, cytochrome c and AIF was evaluated to further identify the apoptotic effects of wogonin at the protein level. The results indicate that wogonin is able to influence mitochondrial membrane stability and decrease mitochondria membrane potential (Δψm). This was evidenced by JC-1 staining, decreased mcl-1 expression and the release of cytochrome C and AIF into the cytoplasm. Cleaved PARP and decreased XIAP and survivin expression may also have contributed to the progression of apoptosis.

HDAC1 and HDAC2 are Class I HDACs that deacetylate histone and non-histone proteins [5]. They suppress gene expression, and modify tumor specific proteins involved in progression [4]. Our results show that the mRNA and protein levels of HDAC1 and HDAC2 were both decreased in the presence of wogonin, indicating that acetylated histone protein may promote expression of tumor suppressive proteins and thereby inhibit tumor progression.

An inter-relationship exists between c-Myc and Skp2 such that c-Myc promotes Skp2 expression, and Skp2 targets c-Myc for ubiquitin-dependent degradation [11], [12], [24], [25]. In our experiments, wogonin down-regulated c-Myc and Skp2 at the protein level, but the mRNA expression of c-Myc increased 1.6-fold. These findings suggest that the proteasomal degradation pathway may be related to the reversal of c-Myc. However, since Skp2 expression decreased, we focused our further experiments on Fbw7α, another proteasome recognition subunit that targets c-Myc.

Thr58 phophorylation of c-Myc is required for Fbw7α mediated c-Myc degradation [24]. As Thr58 is phophorylated by GSK3β, we evaluated expression levels of Fbw7α, Thr58 c-Myc and GSK3β. In these experiments Fbw7α expression decreased at the protein level but not at the mRNA level. Thr58 phophorylation of c-Myc increased to some degree and GSK3β expression at both the mRNA and protein level decreased. These results highlight lack of conformity between Fbw7α mRNA and protein levels, the decreased expression of GSK3β, and the increased phophorylation of c-Myc at Thr58.

A previous study demonstrated that phosphorylation of Thr58 in A549 cells occurred independently of GSK3β [42]. However, GSK3β is the only known kinase that phosphorylates c-Myc at Thr58. In our studies the proteasome inhibitor MG132 was unable to prevent the degradation of c-Myc suggesting that decreased Fbw7α and Skp2 might be involved in this process. However, the exact mechanism involved requires further research.

Taken together our findings suggest that the ability of wogonin to influence different biochemical pathways may explain its activity against a variety of different cancers. Our data may also in part explain why some gene deficient cells (e.g. those with Fbw7α deficiency) are resistant to wogonin.

Currently, pancreatic cancer is the fourth cause of cancer death. In 2013, it is estimated that approximately 38,460 people will die of pancreatic cancer. Early detection of malignant cyst (pancreatic cancer precursor) is necessary to help prevent late diagnosis of the tumor. In this study, we characterized glycoproteins and non-glycoproteins on pooled mucinous (n=10) and non-mucinous (n=10) pancreatic cyst fluid to identify ‘proteins of interest’ to differentiate between mucinous cyst from non-mucinous cyst and investigate these proteins as potential biomarker targets. An automated multi-lectin affinity chromatography (M-LAC) platform was utilized for glycoprotein enrichment followed by nano-LC-MS/MS analysis. Spectral count quantitation allowed for the identification of proteins with significant differential levels in mucinous cysts from non-mucinous cysts of which one protein (periostin) was confirmed via immunoblotting. To exhaustively evaluate differentially expressed proteins, we used a number of proteomic tools including; gene ontology classification, pathway and network analysis, Novoseek data mining and chromosome gene mapping. Utilization of complementary proteomic tools, revealed that several of the proteins such as mucin 6 (MUC6), bile salt-activated lipase (CEL) and pyruvate kinase lysozyme M1/M2 with significant differential expression have strong association with pancreatic cancer. Further, chromosome gene mapping demonstrated co-expressions and co-localization of some proteins of interest including 14-3-3 protein epsilon (YWHAE), pigment epithelium derived factor (SERPINF1) and oncogene p53.

Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest cancers with a 95% mortality rate within 5years after diagnosis.1 The main cause for an almost 100% death rate of pancreatic cancer is attributed to late detection of the tumor and subsequent late diagnosis of the disease.2-4 It is a difficult task to accurately make a prognosis of pancreatic cancer because pancreatic tumors are pathologically diverse with similar clinical and radiological characteristics.5-6 The most effective means to reduce mortality from pancreatic cancer may be to identify and remove precursor lesions before they progress to invasive cancer. Pancreatic cysts are potential precursors of pancreatic cancer that can be identified through non-invasive imaging and therefore detectable prior to progression.7 Some pancreatic cyst lesions do not have malignant potential, including; pseudocysts and serous cystadenomas (referred to as non-mucinous cysts), and others are established cancer precursors, including mucinous cystic neoplasms and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (referred to as mucinous cysts). Unfortunately, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish the mucinous from the non-mucinous cysts by imaging or by clinical symptoms.6 Although, there are a number of parameters and techniques currently available for classifying malignant lesions and non-malignant lesions, more needs to be done since none of these methods provides definitive results.8

Glycoproteomics play an essential role in biomarker discovery studies of biological samples since an alteration in glycan structures and cellular glycosylation profile are closely related to cellular regulation and malignancy.9-11 Investigating and analyzing glycoproteins of pancreatic cyst fluid represents a potentially valuable source for information and can benefit in differentiating mucinous from non-mucinous cysts. In glycoproteomics, specific glycoproteins and glyco-isoforms are enriched followed by matrix assisted laser desorption or liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis. Previous studies have demonstrated that by using antibody-lectin sandwich microarray some protein families and their glycan variants can be glyco-biomarker targets for accurate differentiation of mucinous cyst from non-mucinous cyst 9. Also, lectin based glycoproteomics of pancreatic cyst fluid have identified specific glycans and glycoforms as possible biomarker targets to differentiate mucinous cyst from non-mucinous cyst10-11.

We have focused on the application of glycoproteins enrichment via a high performance multi-lectin affinity chromatography (HP-MLAC) method12 to differentiate mucinous pancreatic cyst fluid subtypes from non-mucinous pancreatic cyst fluid subtypes. HP-MLAC is a robust and high throughput high performance multi-lectin affinity chromatography platform that combines the depletion of two highly abundant proteins (human immunoglobulins and albumin), enrichment of glycoproteins and glyco-isoforms by multiple lectins (ConA, WGA and Jac) followed by a reversed phase sample clean up on an HPLC system. This platform is shown to result in the identification of potential glyco-biomarker targets, in plasma of breast cancer patients.12-13 We present in this report the glycoproteome as well as the non-glycoproteome landscape of pancreatic cyst fluid, which allows us to study the differences between mucinous cyst fluid vs. non-mucinous cyst fluid. First, we present data analysis based on our glycoprotein fractionation platform which indicated that a combination of high abundance protein depletion and enrichment by M-LAC followed by 1D SDS-PAGE fractionation allows us to characterize not only glycoproteins but also low abundant proteins which may be potential glyco-biomarker targets of interest.14 By using different complementary proteomics tools such as; gene ontology, Novoseek, pathway analysis, network interactions and chromosome gene mapping analysis, we show that ‘proteins of interest’ selected via spectral count have significant cancer associations and provides a good list for selection of target proteins for pancreatic cyst biomarker discovery.
2.1. Reagents
Pancreatic cyst fluid samples used in this study were obtained from Dr. Brian Haab’s laboratory at the Van Andel Research Institute (Grand Rapids, MI). Lectins for M-LAC column were purchased from Vector laboratories (Burlingame, CA). Capture select (R) ligand with specificity for albumin proteins and protein G with affinity for immunoglobulin’s (IgA, IgM, and IgG) were obtained from BAC. B. V., Netherlands and Life Technologies, Inc. (Carlsbad, CA) respectively. POROS 20 R1 and POROS beads for conjugation were also purchased from Applied Biosystems (Framingham, MA). Sequencing grade modified trypsin was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). HPLC-MS grade water, formic acid, acetonitrile and other buffer reagents were all purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA).

2.2. Pancreatic cyst fluid samples
All pancreatic cyst samples involved in this study were collected in compliance with the guidelines of the local Institutional Review Boards at the University of Michigan Medical Center, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, the University of Arizona Medical Center, the University of Pittsburg Medical Center and Ospedale Sacro Cuore-Don Calabria Negrar, Italy. Due to limited amount of materials, pancreatic cyst fluid samples for glycoproteomics were pooled into mucinous subtypes (potential malignant lesions) which includes; intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) and mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCN) and non-mucinous subtypes (benign lesions) comprise of serous cystadenomas (SC) and pseudocysts (PC) for glycoproteomic studies. Mucin-like proteins, fats and other particulate matter were depleted from cyst fluid samples as follows; 200 μL volume of each pool was mixed with equal volumes of 20 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4 in 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes. Samples were vortexed briefly and centrifuged for 15 minutes at 6,000 × g. Supernatants were carefully separated from precipitated materials into a conditioned (equal ratio water/ethanol mixture) MWCO 3kDa micron centrifugal filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA) to buffer exchange with HP MLAC binding buffer (25 mM Tris, 0.5 M NaCl, 1 mM MnCl2, 1 mM CaCl2 and 0.05% sodium azide, pH 7.4). This was followed by BCA protein assay and immediate storage at −80°C until glycoproteomic analysis. Samples were thawed not more than twice for each experiment.

2.3. Sample fractionation and glycoproteins enrichment
200 μg each of mucinous subtypes and non-mucinous subtypes were fractionated and enriched for glycoproteins on an HP-MLAC platform as previously described 12. Briefly, high abundance proteins (IgG and albumin) were depleted followed by the HP-MLAC glycoprotein enrichment and sample desalting all on-line; preventing sample degradation and sample loses. The on-line sample preparation was performed on a 2D HPLC System (Shimadzu, Columbia, MD) equipped with three valves to allow for switching among the three columns connected serially. 0.1 M glycine, pH 2.5 was the elution buffer for POROS protein G and Capture select(R) ligand albumin-IgG columns. For the HP-MLAC glycoprotein affinity column, 0.1 M acetic acid pH 2.5 was used to elute M-LAC bound proteins. POROS 50 R1 reversed-phase PEEK column was used to desalt unbound and bound fractions collected. For desalting, solvent A was made of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in milli-q water and that of B was composed of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile. 70% solvent B step gradient was used to elute bound proteins on the POROS R1 column. Unbound protein fractions (no specificity for M-LAC column) were collected separately from M-LAC bound fractions. All fractions collected were speed vacuum to dryness.

2.4. 1D SDS-PAGE analysis followed by in-gel Trypsin digestion
20 μg of each fraction was loaded on 10% Mini-PROTEAN® TGX™ Precast Gels and run on a Mini-PROTEAN Tetra cell system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) for 40 minutes at a constant voltage of 200V. Gels were stained after electrophoresis following manufacturer’s instructions with SimplyBlue ™ SafeStain (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Each fraction was excised into 10 separate bands and processed in a low binding centrifuge tubes as earlier described15, with some modifications. Briefly, each band was cut into 1mm × 1mm × 1mm pieces and destained as follows; 500 μL of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate pH 8.0, 500 μL acetonitrile in that order for up to 5 cycles. In each instance, addition of the appropriate solvent, 5 minutes vortexing, short spin on a bench-top centrifuge and aspiration of solvent to waste were performed in a sequence. After the aspiration of acetonitrile in the last cycle, dehydrated gel pieces were dried in a speed vacuum, reduced at 56°C for 30 minutes with 0.5 M dithiothreitol (DTT) in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate pH 8.0 to a final concentration of 25 mM, and alkylated with 0.5 M iodoacetamide in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate pH 8.0 to a final concentration of 50 mM at room temperature for 30 minutes in the dark. Gel pieces were washed with 500 μL 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate 3 times and dehydrated with 500 μL acetonitrile. 50 μL of freshly prepared 0.04 μg/μL of sequencing grade trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) prepared in 25mM ammonium bicarbonate containing 3% acetonitrile (v/v) pH 8.0 was added to the dehydrated gel pieces. Low binding centrifuge tubes containing gel pieces were incubated on ice for 45 minutes to allow for trypsin enzyme absorption. Excess trypsin was aspirated after 45 minutes and enough digestion buffer (25 mM ammonium bicarbonate containing 3% acetonitrile (v/v) pH 8.0) was added to cover gel pieces and incubated at 37°C for approximately 20 hr. Peptides were extracted into labeled low binding centrifuge tubes in the following fashion; 200 μL of 5% formic acid/ 50% acetonitrile twice and 200 μL 100% acetonitrile once. Aspirated supernatants were pooled for each individual excised band and dried completely in a speed vacuum. Dried peptides were constituted in 20 μL 0.1% formic acid in HPLC grade water prior to nano-LC-MS/MS analysis.

2.5. Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis
In-gel tryptic digested peptides were subjected to nano-LC-MS/MS analysis on an LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) equipped with an Ultimate 3000 HPLC (LC Packings-Dionex, Marlton, NJ, USA). A 75μm reversed phase C18 column was packed in-house using a slurry of 5-μ particle, 200-Å pore size Magic C18 stationary phase (Michrom Bioresources, Auburn, CA) into a 150mm × 75mm i.d. capillary column (New Objective, Woburn, MA). The peptides were loaded onto the C18 capillary column using an auto sampler and desalted for 30 mins at a flow-rate of 300nl/min in isocratic mode. The following constituted the mobile phase buffers; mobile phase A consisted of 0.1% formic acid in HPLC grade water and mobile phase B consisted of 0.1% formic acid in HPLC grade acetonitrile. Flow rate was automatically adjusted to 200 nL/min for gradient separation of desalted peptides using the following gradient method; 5% B buffer to 40% B buffer for 80 mins; 40% B buffer to 90% B buffer for 15 mins; 90% B buffer to 2% B buffer for 5mins. The total time for nano-LC-MS/MS analysis was 140 mins. The mass spectrometer was operated in a data dependent fashion; eight most abundant precursor ions selected from the MS spectrum were MS/MS fragmented via collision induced dissociation (CID) using an isolation width of 3.0 mass unit. A resolution, R of 60,000 was used to acquire each full MS scan over a mass range of 400-2000 m/z. Dynamic exclusion was set with 1 repeating counts (repeat duration of 30s, exclusion list of 150, and exclusion duration of 30s, exclusion mass width 0.55 m/z low and 1.55 m/z high).

2.6. Data processing and Bioinformatics
Protein identification was obtained by searching the generated MS/MS spectra against Uniprot annotated human database (release 2012_1; 34,157 entries) using Thermo Fisher Proteome Discoverer 1.3 suite (Thermo Electron Corp, San Jose, CA). Both MASCOT (Matrix Science) version 2.3 and SEQUEST (Thermo Electron) algorithms present in the Thermo Fischer Proteome Discoverer suite were used simultaneously to perform the search. This approach was utilized because it is shown that combined algorithms increases the number of proteins identified and reduces false positive identification in shot gun proteomics.16-17 Confidence in identification was enhanced by applying the reverse database with a false discovery rate (FDR) targeted at 1% at the peptide level. The following are the other search parameters used; 2 maximum missed cleavages, enzyme was set at full trypsin, carbamidomethylation on cysteine as static modification, precursor ion mass tolerance and fragment ion mass tolerance were set at 5ppm and 0.8Da respectively. PANTHER (Protein ANalysis THrough Evolutionary Relationships) database (http://pantherdb.org/) was used to determine gene ontology (GO) Molecular Function. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, Gene A La Cart (provided by www.genecards.org) version 3.10 was used to assign gene symbols as well as protein disease relationships. Novoseek (www.novoseek.com), a biomedical text mining tool was used to acquire disease relevance to gene scores.

2.7. Western Blot Analysis
10% Mini-PROTEAN® TGX™ Precast Gels (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) and Tris/Glycine SDS running buffer were used to resolve 5ug of proteins for each sample. Blotting was performed on Bio-Rad’s Transfer-Blot Turbo transfer system for 10mins. The primary antibody (rabbit polyclonal, 1:500) was purchased from Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO. Goat anti Rabbit HRP (System Biosciences, Mountain View, CA) was used as the secondary antibody. Immuno-detected proteins were visualized using ECL Western Blotting reagents (GE Healthcare), and images were captured with a Fluorchem SP system (Alpha Innotech, Santa Clara, CA.
3.1. Analytical Strategy
To achieve good depth of glycoproteome analysis of the cyst fluid samples we used a 4 step chromatographic strategy, namely 1) abundant protein depletion, 2) lectin based chromatography 3) 1D SDS-PAGE separation and 4) capillary LC reversed phase separation of the mixture of tryptic peptides generated by a trypsin digest of the resulting 10 gel bands. In previous publications we have described our lectin platform which is based on a physical admixture of 3 different lectins that are individually bound to different chromatographic beads (termed multi-lectin affinity chromatography or M-LAC). We showed that such an admixture gave approximately a 10-fold increase relative to total proteins in binding efficiency that was based on the glycoside clustering effect.18-19 Furthermore the ratio of an individual glycoprotein that was partitioned into the bound or unbound fraction was reproducible and reflected the types of glycan present in an individual protein. Also, changes in the ratios in a global protein analysis can yield information on changes in glycan motifs in glycoproteins resulting from diseases such as cancer and diabetes.20-21 As mentioned in the introduction, pancreatic cancer is both difficult to diagnose and appropriate clinical samples are difficult to obtain. We initiated the study with a sample set of 20 individual cyst samples and performed protein concentration, 1D SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometric analysis. It was clear from this phase of the investigation that a study with meaningful depth of analysis of samples with such rare availability would not permit replicate analyses. Patients’ samples were grouped (Table 1) into mucinous and non mucinous cyst subtypes based on clinical diagnosis and classification as previously discussed 6 and then pooled (mucinous cyst fluid=10 and non mucinous cyst fluid=10 samples in the two groups respectively). While cyst fluid offers an ideal proximal fluid for the observation of ‘proteins of interest’ that change in either concentration or amount of glycosylation motifs in cancer, it is a sample that is highly variable and of limited amount. For this phase of the investigation we found that pools were necessary to permit an effective depletion of contaminating blood proteins and to achieve good depth of glycoproteome analysis of the bound and unbound M-LAC fractions. Another advantage of pooling is that individual patient variability would be minimized and that resulting ‘proteins of interest’ would likely to be of more general applicability.22 We also had access to sufficient patient numbers to permit the preparation of a second pool of mucinous and non-mucinous cyst samples and thus to performed a second analysis (second sample set). Since the second pool contained a different set of individuals, the analysis would generate a second list of ‘proteins of interest’ that could be compared with the first analysis and be used to explore the differences in cyst fluid in mucinous and non-mucinous pancreatic cancer.

3.2. Glycoproteome and non-glycoproteome platform
As described earlier, our HP-MLAC based platform (see supplementary info fig 1) used two protein (2P, albumin and IgG) depletion followed by multi-lectin affinity chromatography (M-LAC) glycoproteins enrichment and then 1D SDS-PAGE fractionation of eluted M-LAC bound and unbound proteins. The decision to perform 2P depletion was based on a preliminary analysis of a set of pancreatic cyst fluid samples that showed highly variable and in many cases a significant contamination of albumin and IgG’s (supplementary info figure 2) as well as demonstrating that the depth of resulting proteomic analysis was improved (data not shown). We selected lectins for the M-LAC column with broad specificity for glycans typically present in cancer and showed no non-specific binding in the M-LAC platform, namely Concanavalin A (ConA), Artocarpus integrifolia (Jacalin) and Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) lectins (high mannose, glycans; galactose and O-linked glycans; and N-acetylglucosamine and sialic acid glycans respectively). As shown later (Table 2A), some proteins in the bound fraction are not known to be glycosylated (e.g. carboxypeptidases (CPA)) which are previously attributed to either non-specific binding or binding to a glycosylated carrier protein.12 In a pilot study we showed that the 1D SDS-PAGE separation step followed by in-gel trypsin digestion of 10 gel bands improved depth of proteins identification by more than 2 fold compared to in-solution trypsin digestion of protein fractions with no prior proteins or peptides level separation (data not shown).

3.3. Summary of glycoproteome and non-glycoproteome data
To increase confidence and positive proteins identification, we used a 5ppm peptide mass tolerance and false discovery rate (FDR) targeted at 1% during MS/MS database search analysis. A total average of 520 unique proteins was identified between the two sample sets of which mucinous subtypes had 230 proteins and 290 proteins belonging to non-mucinous subtypes. A detailed table of the number of identified and quantified proteins can be found in supplementary table S1, S4-S7. A four way Venn diagram was used to understand the distribution of unique and shared proteins for individual M-LAC fractions in each sample set (Figure 1). Percent ratio for unbound vs. bound in mucinous and non mucinous fractions (79.7 vs. 72.2 and 65.5 vs. 66.0 respectively) is similar in both sample set 1 and sample set 2 (supplementary table 1). This observation is supported by molecular function characterization obtained from PANTHER, a web-based gene ontology classification system23 showing protein abundance of each molecular function as their relative percentage. The corresponding unbound mucinous and non-mucinous fractions showed similar results (data not shown). The similarity in protein molecular function for the M-LAC fractions presents a similar picture between mucinous and non-mucinous (M-LAC bound and unbound fractions). As expected, we observed variability in identified proteins (427 unique proteins in analysis set 1 vs. 298 unique proteins in analysis set 2) due to two possibilities; 1) different levels of albumin contamination; and 2) individual differences between sample set 1 and sample set 2 (supplementary figure S2A & 2B).

3.4. Quantitation of glycoproteins in different analysis set and selection of potential protein targets of interest
Based on BCA total protein assay, equal amounts of cyst fluid pools (200μg) were depleted and separated on the M-LAC column. Protein recoveries were determined using BCA total protein assay. Total recovery range of 84%-85% of yield of the starting material after M-LAC fractionation was recorded. This result is consistent with earlier published work.24 Proteins were quantitated for differential expression by spectral counts (total MS/MS spectra collected for each protein), a label free semi-quantitative method developed for shot-gun proteomics and proteins with ≥ 2 unique peptides were used in quantitation. In selected cases, spectral counts were confirmed by peak area measurements of extracted ion chromatogram (EIC) as previously described14 as well as manual inspection of MS/MS spectra. Briefly, mass spectrometry data was first normalized by the reference ratio calculated from total spectral counts of mucinous and non-mucinous M-LAC fractions for each protein. Relative protein abundance changes were based on the ratios of spectral counts of mucinous and non mucinous M-LAC bound and unbound fractions after normalization. The algorithm used for reference ratio calculations and protein abundance calculations were previously published.13 Proteins with spectral count ratio ≥ 5.0 or ≤ 0.3 were assigned as differentially expressed. In cases where no peptides (“0”) were observed for a protein, “1” was added for meaningful ratio calculations.

The development of a disease marker is preceded by a comprehensive discovery program such as in this study of pancreatic cyst fluid. In this type of study, it is premature to discuss biomarker candidates which will require a study of larger number of individual patient samples. Our goal is to determine ‘proteins of interest’ (see Table 2A & 2B) for the M-LAC bound and unbound subproteomes based on four criteria; 1) high protein abundance (spectral count), 2) presence of protein in both sample sets analyzed, 3) significance to pancreatic cancer and other related diseases, and 4) spectral count ratio changes (higher or lower protein levels) as grouped in table 2A and ​and2B.2B. Of particular interest are proteins that are mostly expressed in high levels in mucinous fractions including pancreatic cancer related proteins (pancreatic lipases, amylases, mucin 2, calcium-activated chloride channel regulator 1, catalase, bile salt-activated lipase, carboxypeptidase etc.), and energy metabolism associated proteins (hexokinase-1, phosphoglycerate kinase 1, pyruvate kinase isozymes M1/M2, etc.). Also, chaperone function proteins (heat shock family proteins) were observed with higher protein levels (table 2B). It is interesting to note that periostin, an extracellular matrix protein and a low abundance protein implicated in pancreatic cancer and other cancers25-29 was found in lower levels in mucinous cyst fluid. As part of a pilot pre-validation study, POSTN was investigated by western blots (see below). Some proteins in the M-LAC bound fraction potentially are not glycosylated (such as Alpha-amylase 2B, Carboxypeptidase A2, and Pyruvate kinase isozymes M1/M2), but may be associated with a glycoprotein due to their function (protein binding and metal ion binding) or bind to the column as a result of non-specific binding of lectins.

Unlike the analysis of molecular function classification for total proteins identified in the bound and unbound M-LAC fractions, the list of ‘proteins of interest’ showed significant differences between the fractions in specific proteins (Figure 2) when molecular function classification analysis was performed. Proteins with antioxidant activity, for example, catalase (CAT) and Glutathione S-transferase A1 were observed to be highly enriched in the unbound sub-proteome (Figure 2 (A)). On the other hand, proteins with receptor binding activity and proteins involved in structural functions were exclusively detected in the M-LAC bound glycoproteome (Figure 2 (B)). Bile salt-activated lipase (CEL) long and short isoforms were observed to be differentiated by our M-LAC column (see supplementary table 2A & 2B and supplementary figure 3 (MS/MS for long isoform diagnostic peptide)), with higher levels observed in M-LAC bound fraction of mucinous cyst fluid. CEL is a heavily O-linked glycosylated digestive enzyme30 implicated in diabetes and pancreatic exocrine dysfunction.32 Previous studies of CEL31,32 shows O-linked glycosylation sites found at the C-tail fragment which binds to Jac lectin, a constituent of our M-LAC column. It is possible that due to glycosylation changes, CEL long isoform selectively binds to the M-LAC column while the short isoform flows through the M-LAC column. Recent studies by Mann and colleagues reported an observation of significant high levels of CEL in fucose enriched samples, suggesting CEL as a potential glyco-biomarker target in pancreatic cyst fluid.10 Our findings of M-LAC’s ability to enrich CEL long isoform in mucinous cyst fluid subtypes contributes to recent observation, 10 therefore M-LAC may contribute significantly to future structural and glycosylation alteration studies of CEL in pancreatic cyst fluid.

Novoseek, a data mining tool from Genecards human gene database (Version 3.10), was used to investigate the relationship to pancreatic disease of selected potential target proteins. The analysis revealed that, the majority of our selected targets are involved in a variety of pancreatic diseases such as pancreatic cancer and pancreatitis (Table 2A & 2B), consistent with earlier reports.33 In supplementary document table 3, details of specific pancreatic disease association with each target protein is listed. Since we do not know which of these targets will be secreted into the blood, the next phase of study will determine which of these disease related targets are measurable in blood as such observations will depend on the biology of the disease and the huge dynamic range of plasma.

3.5. Pathway and network interaction analysis of potential targets of interest
Recent studies34,35 have suggested that a perturbed module (pathway or biological process) is a better disease marker than one or more biomarkers and thus discovery studies should have such a focus. Furthermore, it has been shown that prioritizing cancer associated protein observations together with protein-protein interaction network information can add further discrimination. 36 To determine the pathway of interest, we used the pathway listed in Genecards with the greatest concentration of our ‘proteins of interest’ which resulted in the selection of the pancreatic secretion pathway (KEGG, Figure 3). The relevance of this pathway was shown by the clustering of proteins involved in the pancreatic secretion process that were present in either M-LAC bound fraction and/or unbound fractions (highlighted in red, blue and yellow in figure 4). Examples include: alpha-amylase 2B (AMY2B), bile salt activated lipase (CEL), pancreatic triacylglycerol lipase (PNLIP), pancreatic lipase-related protein 2 (PNLIPR2), and carboxypeptidases (CPA, CPB), and in the unbound fraction observed proteins include; chymotrypsinogen B1 (CTRB1) and pancreatic lipase-related (PNLIPR1) (denoted (a) and (b) in Figure 4 respectively). The presence of higher levels of proteins in mucinous cyst fluid (blue and red circles in figure 4), their clustering and the fact that some target proteins physically associate (CEL, PNLIP, and PNLIRP2), as shown in the interactome data (figure 4), is an indication of the significance of these identified proteins in pancreatic cyst biology.

3.6. Chromosome gene mapping analysis of potential targets of interest
It has been observed that protein coding genes which express proteins that have related functions, such as tissue location, cellular compartment, common pathways or interactants are more likely to be co-located in the same chromosomal region.37,38 In such situations co-expression can be facilitated by mechanisms such as cis-activation or suppression (gene slicing) of specific chromosomal regions. In this context, we submitted selected proteins of interest to the Gene A La Cart (provided by www.genecards.com, uploaded to Gene A La Cart for analysis in August, 2011) to obtain genomic location and Ensemble cytobands. It is of interest that some of the proteins identified in the M-LAC fractions with protein level change in mucinous vs. non-mucinous are located in specific chromosomal regions (table 3), e.g. chromosome 1, band p21 and 36 (amylase and elastase); chromosome 10, band 25&26 (lipases). Also catalase (CAT) is located in the same genomic region as the important cancer associated genes MUC2 and 6 (chromosome 11, bands p13 and p15). Further, several of the enzyme groups such as PNLIPRP1, and PNLIP, are co-located in the same chromosome region and potentially co-expressed in cancer, which is consistent with other studies such as the ERBB2 amplicon.39,40 It is interesting to note that SERPINF1, YWHAE and NPEPPS genes (proteins involved in; proteolytic events of cell growth, various signaling pathways, and inhibitor of angiogenesis respectively) are located in the same band (p13 and p21) on chromosome 17 as the important apoptotic gene p53. Future studies will explore the potential role of co-expressions in the development of pancreatic cancer and the potential role of these genes since this is the first report on such observations.

3.7. Validation of Periostin
As part of a pilot pre-validation of differentially expressed target proteins identified, we analyzed periostin (POSTN) by western blot using six samples; three mucinous and three non-mucinous pancreatic cyst fluid subtypes. POSTN was chosen for investigation from the protein target list because of its potential significance in pancreatic cancer progression and other related diseases 41 as well as its over expression in breast cancer 42 which is in contrast to our observations. POSTN was immuno-precipitated using anti-periostin antibody and the blot detected by anti-periostin antibody measuring total POSTN protein levels at a molecular weight of 89kDa. Significant lower POSTN levels was found in mucinous cyst subtypes; intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) and mucinous cyst neoplasm (MCN), compared to non-mucinous cyst subtypes; serous cystadenoma (figure 5A). An 8 fold relative increase of POSTN in non-mucinous cyst fluid was observed (figure 5B) after densitometry quantification correlating spectral count observations of cyst pools. Periostin (POSTN) was previously reported to be a potential biomarker target in pancreatic cancer, 43 however its role in pancreatic cyst is not known. Although POSTN is known to be glycosylated with one N-linked site, its glycosylation patterns with pancreatic cancer has not been studied. Future studies are required to understand cancer related glycosylation changes of periostin and its overall role in pancreatic cyst fluid.

We have demonstrated that the high performance multi-lectin affinity chromatography (HP-MLAC) platform successfully allows the enrichment and characterization of glycoproteins which are present at different levels in mucinous and non-mucinous cyst fluid subtypes. Of particular interest is the observation of increased amounts in the mucinous vs. non mucinous cyst fluid of proteins with strong cancer associations such as; mucin 2 (MUC2), mucin 6 (MUC6), carboxypeptidase A2 (CPA), and hexokinase-1(HK1), proteins with energy metabolism functions as well as various pancreatic enzymes. The significance of the identified proteins was further shown with pathway analysis, interaction and chromosomal location investigations. In addition, bile salt-activated lipase (CEL) long isoform was significantly enriched in M-LAC fractions and differentially bound to M-LAC column thus indicating possible glycosylation changes in mucinous cyst fluid. Since these observations are based on cyst fluid pools of 20 individuals (10 mucinous cyst subtypes and 10 non-mucinous cyst subtypes), we believe that the true picture will be confirmed by analyzing individual samples that constitute the pools. In this discovery study, glycoproteomics is used to explore differentially expressed proteins to differentiate mucinous cyst fluid from non-mucinous cyst fluid. In future studies we plan to; 1) investigate selected ‘proteins of interest’ using anti-body lectin sandwich microarray platform 9,44 in a larger cohort; 2) potentially measure ‘proteins of interest’ in a readily available diagnostic fluid i.e. plasma; and 3) explore chromosome gene co-expressions and co-locations of ‘proteins of interest’ and their importance to pancreatic cancer.

In a large number of plant species hydroxynitrile lyases catalyze the decomposition of cyanohydrins in order to generate hydrogen cyanide upon tissue damage. Hydrogen cyanide serves as a deterrent against herbivores and fungi. In vitro hydroxynitrile lyases are proficient biocatalysts for the stereospecific synthesis of cyanohydrins. Curiously, hydroxynitrile lyases from different species are completely unrelated in structure and substrate specificity despite catalyzing the same reaction. The hydroxynitrile lyase from almond shows close resemblance to flavoproteins of the glucose−methanol−choline oxidoreductase family. We report here 3D structural data of this lyase with the reaction product benzaldehyde bound within the active site, which allow unambiguous assignment of the location of substrate binding. Based on the binding geometry, a reaction mechanism is proposed that involves one of the two conserved active site histidine residues acting as a general base abstracting the proton from the cyanohydrin hydroxyl group. Site-directed mutagenesis shows that both active site histidines are required for the reaction to occur. There is no evidence that the flavin cofactor directly participates in the reaction. Comparison with other hydroxynitrile lyases reveals a large diversity of active site architectures, which, however, share the common features of a general active site base and a nearby patch with positive electrostatic potential. On the basis of the difference in substrate binding geometry between the FAD-dependent HNL from almond and the related oxidases, we can rationalize why the HNL does not act as an oxidase.

Hydroxynitrile lyases (HNLs)1 are key enzymes in the process of cyanogenesis, which is widespread among higher plants, bacteria, fungi, and insects including major food crops like cassava, sorghum, and lima beans (1). Cyanogenic organisms release toxic hydrogen cyanide from damaged tissues as a defense agent against herbivoral and fungal attack (2). HNLs catalyze the last and crucial step in the reaction cascade, i.e., the decomposition of a cyanohydrin into HCN and the corresponding aldehyde or ketone. Several different classes of HNLs are known to date, some of which contain an FAD cofactor (FAD−HNL). Despite catalyzing the same reaction they differ in substrate specificity and do not share any significant homology on either sequence or structural level. Due to these substantial differences, HNLs from different species are believed to have evolved from unrelated precursor proteins by convergent evolution (3,4). The importance of these enzymes as part of the “body armor” of an organism is also underlined by their generally high abundance in the tissues. In recent years HNLs have attracted considerable attention from industry, as the reverse reaction, the addition of HCN to a wide range of different aldehydes and ketones, can be exploited for the synthesis of enantiomerically pure cyanohydrins. The latter are important building blocks for the synthesis of several pharmaceutical and agrochemical products, such as anticoagulants and pyrethroid insecticides (5).

To date 3D structures are known for four HNLs. Three of them, the HNLs from Hevea brasiliensis (HbHNL (6,7)), Manihot esculenta (MeHNL (8)), and Sorghum bicolor (SbHNL (9)), adopt α/β-hydrolase folds. The fourth, the FAD−HNL from Prunus amygdalus (almond, PaHNL), closely resembles glucose−methanol−choline (GMC) oxidoreductases despite not catalyzing a redox reaction (10). Members of this family include glucose oxidase (GOX), cholesterol oxidase (CHOX), pyranose 2-oxidase (POX), and aryl-alcohol oxidase (AAO) (11), but no other lyase. The role of the FAD cofactor in the reaction mechanism of PaHNL sparked much debate over the years (12−15). In the absence of a substrate, product, or inhibitor complex structure of an FAD−HNL, the reaction mechanism and the role of the FAD cofactor have been under discussion, with biochemical and modeling studies indicating an active site location near the flavin isoalloxazine ring (12,14,16−18). Based on these studies, a tentative catalytic mechanism was proposed involving general acid/base catalysis (14). However, the exact location and geometry of substrate binding are currently unknown.

We present here the crystal structure of the PaHNL1 isoform in complex with its natural reaction product benzaldehyde, resulting from a soaking experiment with the substrate mandelonitrile. The results unequivocally show for the first time the exact location of product/substrate binding within the active site and reveal the framework of interactions between reaction product and active site residues. A reaction mechanism is proposed that shares features with FAD-independent HNLs despite their differences in structure and sequence. A comparison with other GMC oxidoreductases leads us to conclude that the FAD cofactor is too far away from the substrate in order to directly participate in the reaction mechanism. Furthermore, the geometry of binding is not suited for oxidation of benzyl alcohol, the logical substrate in a potential oxidation reaction.
Enzyme Purification and Crystallization
PaHNL was purchased from Sigma and purified, the isoforms were separated, and isoform 1 (PaHNL1) was crystallized as previously described (10). Crystallization drops (typical reservoir composition: 20% PEG 4000, 16% 2-propanol, and 0.1 M Na-Ada, pH 7.0) sometimes contained a monoclinic crystal form of space group P21, not readily distinguishable from the triclinic crystal form obtained in most of the crystallization experiments and used for the initial structure determination by multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion (10).

Data Collection, Processing, Model Building, and Refinement
Data sets of the monoclinic crystal form (unliganded and soaked with mandelonitrile) were collected at EMBL beamlines BW7B and X11 (DESY, Hamburg, Germany) equipped with a mar345 imaging plate detector at cryogenic temperatures. Prior to flash freezing, crystals where briefly soaked in a solution derived from the mother liquor by replacing half of the 2-propanol with 8% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol and adding 7% PEG 400 as additional cryoprotectant. Soaking conditions for incubation with the natural substrate were as follows: The crystals were transferred to 12 μL of the cryo solution. Then 1 μL of a racemic mixture of (R)- and (S)-mandelonitrile containing less than 3% contaminating benzaldehyde (kindly provided by DSM Fine Chemicals) was added with a syringe. After 2 min of soaking time the crystal was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. The crystals belonged to space group P21 with cell parameters of a = 69.1 Å, b = 93.7 Å, c = 87.3 Å, and β = 106.4°. Data were processed with the DENZO and SCALEPACK program suite (19). Native Patterson maps and self-rotation functions were consistent with the presence of a noncrystallographic axis almost parallel to the crystallographic 21 screw axis resulting in a translational relation between the two molecules of the asymmetric unit. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the structure from the triclinic PaHNL1 crystal form as the starting model. After one round of rigid body refinement, simulated annealing against a maximum-likelihood target to 2 Å resolution was carried out with the Crystallography and NMR System program suite (20). Several rounds of maximum-likelihood refinement and bulk solvent correction using all data over the whole resolution range were performed. Each cycle of refinement was followed by manual inspection of the electron density maps using the program O (21). During the whole refinement process no NCS restraints were applied in order to determine the differences between the two molecules. Water molecules were accepted based on the quality of the electron density. Only water molecules with B-factors less than 50 Å2 and reasonable hydrogen-bonding geometry were retained. During the final refinement stages alternate conformations were modeled and refined. Some residual weak density in the Fo − Fc maps results from the presence of further carbohydrate molecules at the glycosylation sites, which were impossible to model. The structure of liganded PaHNL1 was solved by rigid body refinement using the native P21 crystal structure. Clear additional electron density was visible in the Fo − Fc maps. (R)-mandelonitrile and benzaldehyde were built with the program Sybyl (Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO). In the active site the reaction product benzaldehyde was modeled into the density. A water molecule (at the expected position of the cyano group) was introduced by a peak search of the Fo − Fc maps calculated with the benzaldehyde omitted. Due to the spherical shape of the density, water was chosen over cyanide as the predominant species present. Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table ​Table1.1. Figures were prepared with Molscript (22), Raster3D (23), and Pymol (DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA).

PaHNL1 Mutagenesis, Expression, and Enzymatic Assay
Site-directed mutagenesis of PaHNL1 to introduce His459Asn and His497Asn mutations was carried out using the Stratagene QuickChange XL kit. Both mutants were expressed in Pichia pastoris X33 with pGAPZA-PaHNL1 as positive control and P. pastoris X-33 as negative control in 200 mL of BMD 1% media (100 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 1.34% YNB, 4 × 10−5% biotin, 1% glucose) for 3 days at 28 °C. Cultures were harvested and the supernatant media concentrated to approximately 1 mL. Expression levels of secreted proteins were assessed by SDS−PAGE. Activity measurements were carried out in parallel for the mutants, wild-type PaHNL1, and the negative control by using mandelonitrile as substrate and following the increase in absorption at 280 nm (24). Due to the background of the concomitant chemical reaction, the low activities of the mutants were not exactly quantifiable.
Overall Structure and Binding Sites
PaHNL1 crystals of space group P21 grew under similar conditions as the triclinic crystals used previously to solve the original structure (10). Monoclinic crystals were used to collect a native data set (to 1.57 Å resolution) and for soaking with the substrate mandelonitrile (data set to 1.67 Å resolution). The unliganded structure was found to agree with the model derived from the triclinic data (maximum rmsd of Cα atoms: 0.54 Å, loop region 222−225 excluded). Interestingly, difference density appeared at two sites after soaking with mandelonitrile. The locations of these binding sites are shown in Figure ​Figure1A.1A. One of them is within the putative active site, i.e., at the interface of the two protein domains above the residue of the flavin isoalloxazine ring (Figure ​(Figure2B).2B). Close inspection of this density indicated that it originates from the reaction product (benzaldehyde) rather than the substrate (mandelonitrile), although the presence of a fraction of uncleaved substrate at low occupancy cannot be excluded. Observation of a product molecule in the active site is not surprising, since the soaking experiment was conducted with a crystal of active native enzyme. A molecule of benzaldehyde and a water molecule were fitted into this density. Comparison of the benzaldehyde B-factors with the B-factors of surrounding residues indicates binding of the ligand with high occupancy.

The Fo − Fc electron density of uncleaved mandelonitrile (in red ball-and-stick representation) in the hydrophobic pocket of the liganded structure is shown, indicating that this site has no catalytic function.

The active site region with its hydrogen-bonding interactions is shown in Figure ​Figure1B;1B; hydrogen bonds exist between benzaldehyde and the hydroxyl group of Tyr457 and the imidazole ring of His497 as well as between the active site water (presumably located in a similar position as the reaction cyanide) and the His459 imidazole and N5 of the flavin. His459 is in hydrogen-bonding interaction with Lys361, whereas His497 is hydrogen bonded to Ser496, which in turn is interacting with a water molecule that interacts with His177 and Arg182. The benzaldehyde aromatic ring is embedded in a hydrophobic pocket consisting of residues Ala111, Val316, Cys328, Phe330, Phe342, His357, and Trp458. Comparison with the unliganded structure (Figure ​(Figure2A,B)2A,B) reveals that two of the three active site water molecules are displaced by benzaldehyde, whose binding otherwise induces only minor structural rearrangements of amino acid side chains (Phe330, Ser332, Phe342, and Trp458).

In view of the known R-selectivity, modeling of the natural substrate (R)-mandelonitrile into the active site is straightforward. In order to obtain the correct enantiomer, the cyano group of the substrate (as well as the site of the cyanide ion in the reverse reaction) must point toward the active site water molecule sequestered between benzaldehyde and the cofactor (Figure ​(Figure2B).2B). This results in a binding geometry which agrees well with results from previous docking studies (14). The cyanohydrin hydroxyl group is held in place by interactions with Cys328, Tyr457, and His497, while the cyano group is pointing toward His459 and N5 of the FAD isoalloxazine ring, displacing the active site water (Figure ​(Figure11B).

In the complex structure, clear density for (R)-mandelonitrile can be seen in a hydrophobic pocket at a second location, which is occupied by a molecule of 2-propanol in the unliganded PaHNL1 structure (10). Apparently, the site discriminates against (S)-mandelonitrile, as racemic mandelonitrile was used for the soaking experiments. The density corresponds to an uncleaved substrate molecule, indicating that no catalytic activity can be attributed to this location (Figure ​(Figure2C).2C). This hydrophobic pocket is not conserved in the related GMC oxidoreductases.

Site-Directed Mutagenesis
FAD−HNLs are highly homologous and typically share over 60% sequence identity. With a few exceptions (see below), all of the active site residues are conserved. In order to delineate the role of the two active site histidines, we mutated His497 and His459 to asparagine and expressed both mutants and wild-type PaHNL1 as secreted proteins in P. pastoris. Activity measurements with the substrate mandelonitrile revealed that both mutants showed less than 5% activity compared to wild type, indicating that both residues are essential for the cleavage reaction.

Superposition with Other GMC Oxidoreductase Ligand Complexes
Available structural data of GMC oxidoreductases in complex with substrates, products, or inhibitors include cholesterol oxidase (CHOX) with the steroid substrate dehydroisoandrosterone (25), cellobiose dehydrogenase (CBDH) in complex with the inhibitor cellobiono-1,5-lactam (26), and pyranose 2-oxidase (POX) in complex with the reaction product 2-keto-β-d-glucose (27), the slow substrate 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (28), or the weak inhibitor acetate (29). Superposition of these structures based on the pteridin moiety of flavin with the PaHNL1−benzaldehyde structure and mandelonitrile-bound model are shown in Figure ​Figure3.3. The structures superimpose well (at least 70% of residues within 3 Å rmsd cutoff), including the conformation of active site residues.

Figure 3
Stereo representation of the superposition of GMC oxidoreductase structures in complex with the respective substrate, inhibitor, or product with the PaHNL1 benzaldehyde complex structure and modeled (R)-mandelonitrile. Structures of CHOX with the steroid substrate dehydroisoandrosterone (25) (ligand shown in green), CBDH in complex with the inhibitor cellobiono-1,5-lactam (26) (ligand shown in dark blue), and POX in complex with the reaction product 2-keto-β-d-glucose (27) (ligand shown in light blue) are superimposed with PaHNL1−benzaldehyde and modeled (R)-mandelonitrile (ligands both shown in red). Superimposed FAD cofactors are depicted in orange, and the two important catalytic residues (His459 and His497 in PaHNL) are shown in light gray. Note the culmination of these structures in a single point close to the flavin isoalloxazine ring N5 atom (drawn in a close-up and highlighted by an arrow) and the mostly conserved active site residues.

Strikingly, the complex structures of all known GMC oxidoreductases overlap in a single point close to the flavin N5 atom at about 3.2 Å distance and an angle with the flavin N10−N5 atoms of ∼102° (Figure ​(Figure3).3). In POX and CBDH, carbon atoms C2 and C1 of the ligands (site of oxidative attack in the proposed binding mode of the natural substrates) are located at this position (26,27). In CHOX it is an active site water (25). For GOX, modeling studies place β-d-glucose in close proximity to the flavin (30), displacing the active site water molecule, similar to the POX−product complex (27).

An active site histidine is the only residue that is strictly conserved throughout the GMC oxidoreductase family (His459 in PaHNL1, His447 in CHOX, His516 in Aspergillus niger GOX, His689 in CBDH, and His548 in POX). This histidine was implicated in proton abstraction from the substrate in POX (27), CBDH (26), and GOX (31,32), while it is hydrogen bonded to the active site water in the substrate complex structure of CHOX (25). Strikingly, in PaHNL1 it is the cyano group that points toward the strictly conserved His459 and not the cyanohydrin’s hydroxyl group. The other well-conserved active site residue is an asparagine in POX, CHOX, and CBDH, which is replaced by a second histidine in AAO, GOX, and PaHNL1 (His497). Mutation of this residue also has severe consequences for enzyme activity in all GMC oxidoreductases examined (33−36). Substrates are consistently about equidistantly bound between these two important active site residues in POX, CBDH, and the GOX and the AAO model), whereby the hydroxyl group, site of oxidative attack, forms hydrogen-bonding interactions to both side chains. In PaHNL1, however, the hydroxyl group of (R)-mandelonitrile is held in place by interactions with His497, Tyr457, and Cys328 and is not sandwiched between His459 and His497.
Reaction Mechanism of PaHNL
The reversible cleavage of α-cyanohydrins into HCN and the corresponding aldehyde or ketone follows an ordered Uni Bi mechanism whereby the aldehyde is the first substrate to be bound in the condensation reaction (13). Together with the structural, mutational, and available biochemical evidence, we propose the mechanism for the reversible cyanohydrin cleavage reaction depicted in Scheme 1: while the (R)-mandelonitrile phenyl group is held in place by numerous hydrophobic interactions, His497 is proposed to act as a general base abstracting the proton from the mandelonitrile hydroxyl group; the modeled complex with mandelonitrile shows that its hydroxyl group is within hydrogen-bonding distance to His497, Cys328, and Tyr457. Cys328 can be ruled out as a general base as it is not conserved among all FAD−HNLs (isoleucine or valine is also observed at this position). The pKa values of the corresponding free amino acids argue for His497 rather than Tyr457 as the general base (the pH optimum of the enzyme is about 5.5). In fact, the interaction network around the mandelonitrile-OH suggests that His497-Nε2 is unprotonated, since Cys328 and Tyr457 both have to act as hydrogen bond donors to the mandelonitrile-OH for lack of any other hydrogen-bonding partner in their vicinity. The only consistent H-bonding network thus assigns His497 the role of H-bond acceptor. While previous biochemical studies had implicated the involvement of a cysteine residue (37), the observation that covalent modification of this cysteine abolishes catalytic activity is readily explained by the close proximity between Cys328 and the substrate binding site.

Scheme 1
Proposed Mechanism of the PaHNL1 Cyanohydrin Cleavage Reaction
The reaction proceeds via general acid/base catalysis through residue His497. The cyanide is stabilized by the overall positive electrostatic potential in the active site region (indicated by a positive charge). The mechanistic details of the reprotonation of cyanide are currently unresolved, but it is likely that His459 is involved in this step. Plausible hydrogen-bonding interactions are indicated by dashed lines. Active site residues are labeled. According to the ordered Uni Bi mechanism benzaldehyde is the last product to leave the active site.

His459, the second active site histidine, is probably responsible for protonation of the cleaved cyanide ion. Protonation of cyanide should be facilitated by an increase in the acidity of His459 (Nε2 of its imidazole ring is 2.9 Å away from the cyano group) due to its interaction with Lys361 (Figure ​(Figure1B).1B). Interestingly, the hydroxyl group of mandelonitrile points away from the flavin N5 atom, suggesting that N5 is not directly involved in the reaction mechanism. This is in line with our previous assertion that the flavin does not directly participate in the reaction mechanism (at least not in a redox role), that an oxidized cofactor is solely required for electrostatic reasons (14), and that substitution at the N5 atom interferes with substrate turnover for steric reasons. We conclude that FAD is an evolutionary remnant from an oxidoreductase precursor whose presence is necessary for the structural integrity of FAD−HNLs. A positive potential at the active site was originally inferred from inhibition studies with a variety of different alcohols, carboxylic acids, and inorganic anions (16). The structure shows that this positive potential, facilitating cyanide ion formation (10,14), is mainly provided by residues Arg194, Arg300, Lys361, and Arg182.

A Common Mechanism for All Hydroxynitrile Lyases?
In solution, cyanohydrin cleavage occurs spontaneously at high pH and is initiated by the deprotonation of the cyanohydrin’s hydroxyl group.

Based on these observations, Becker and Pfeil postulated many years ago that the active site of a hydroxynitrile lyase should at least encompass a suitably positioned general base to abstract a proton from the cyanohydrin hydroxyl group and a nearby positive potential to stabilize the emerging cyanide ion (38). It is an intriguing question if and how these requirements are fulfilled in the variety of different HNLs. The first hydroxynitrile lyase whose reaction mechanism was elucidated on the basis of comprehensive structural, kinetic, and mutagenesis data is the one from H. brasiliensis, which exhibits a stereospecificity opposite to FAD−HNLs (39−41). In this enzyme, the catalytic triad (Ser80-His236-Asp207) undoubtedly acts as general base for the deprotonation of the cyanohydrin hydroxyl group, and an active site lysine (Lys236) provides the positive charge to stabilize the cyanide (40,42). A similar mechanism was proposed for the related enzyme MeHNL (8,43). SbHNL also adopts an α/β hydrolase fold but is related to carboxypeptidases. While its catalytic triad serine is too far away to deprotonate the substrate (9), the carboxylate group of the C-terminal residue (Trp270) was proposed to act as the general base, assisted by an active site water molecule (9). Stabilization of the cyanide by a positive electrostatic potential within the active site has not yet been confirmed for this enzyme.

PaHNL conforms to the requirements postulated for HNL catalysis, although in a very unique fashion. Deprotonation of the substrate and reprotonation of the cleaved cyanide is accomplished by two histidines “inherited” from its precursor oxidoreductase and adapted to the specific requirements of HNL catalysis. Unlike in HbHNL, where a positive electrostatic potential is produced by a single lysine residue, PaHNL has several positively charged residues surrounding the active site to stabilize the nascent cyanide. It will be fascinating to see how convergent evolution has implemented the requirements of HNL catalysis into enzymes belonging to yet other fold families, such as the hydroxynitrile lyase from flax, which belongs to the family of Zn-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases (44).

Features of Substrate Binding in GMC Oxidoreductases
In flavoenzymes the sites of oxidative attack typically cluster in a well-defined position “in front” of the N5 of the FAD isoalloxazine ring at approximately 3.5−3.8 Å distance and at an angle N10(FAD)−N5(FAD)−CH(substrate) in a narrow range of 96−117° (45). As shown in Figure ​Figure33 this is also true for the GMC oxidoreductases POX, CBDH, and most likely GOX and AAO based on substrate−enzyme modeling studies (26,27,30,31,34,36). An exception is the CHOX−substrate crystal structure, where the angle N10−N5−CH is much larger (162°)(25). However, CHOX catalyzes an oxidation and isomerization step, and the crystal structure is unlikely to represent the actual Michaelis complex as soaking was performed under reducing conditions. It is likely that the active site water in the structure, which is sandwiched between the conserved histidine and the asparagine, mimics the substrate’s hydroxyl group (46).

A hydride transfer mechanism has generally been proposed for GMC oxidoreductases although a radical mechanism cannot completely be ruled out at present (26,32,46,47). The well-defined position of the site of oxidative attack is thought to be required for optimal orbital overlap in an efficient hydride transfer to the flavin N5 atom (45). A potential two-step radical mechanism would require similar distance restraints. The only strictly conserved residue within GMC oxidoreductases, the active site histidine (His459 in PaHNL1), is well positioned to deprotonate the substrate. The main difference between the oxidoreductases and PaHNL1 lies in the orientation of the substrates’ hydroxyl groups, which points toward the flavin N5 and the conserved histidine in the oxidoreductases, but away from N5 in PaHNL1, where it is the nitrogen atom of the cyano group that occupies the strategic position close to N5. Consequently, the cyanohydrin hydroxyl group is not within reach of the conserved His459 (over 5 Å away), and it is the second active site histidine, His497, that acts as general base.

FAD−HNLs as Oxidases?
Benzaldehyde is not further oxidized by PaHNL (12,13), nor has any other oxidation substrate been reported, yet PaHNL shows all of the main features of an oxidase (12,13,48,49). The redox potential of the cofactor should be sufficiently high based on its positive electrostatic potential environment (even more positive than in the related oxidases), which should stabilize the anionic reduced form of the cofactor. We previously speculated that FAD−HNLs may have evolved from an aryl-alcohol oxidase precursor protein, given that GMC oxidoreductases generally oxidize nonactivated alcohols and in view of the similarity to aryl-alcohol oxidase sequences (10). Consequently, a potential substrate would be benzyl alcohol, which can safely be assumed to occupy the same position as benzaldehyde. Benzyl alcohol is known to act as competitive inhibitor of FAD−HNLs in the reversible cyanohydrin cleavage reaction (16,50). From the complex structure it is now evident that the site of hypothetical oxidative attack on benzyl alcohol is located ∼5.6 Å away from the flavin N5, clearly too far away for a direct hydride transfer. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that PaHNL acts as an oxidase on this substrate. In addition, His459, which is strictly conserved among the oxidases, probably carries a hydrogen atom at Nε2, which would make it a very unlikely general base for any other potential substrate with a binding geometry more similar to the oxidases. Taken together, we conclude that PaHNL1 is not suitable for oxidizing benzyl alcohol based on the predicted binding geometry. We anticipate that an alcohol substrate that points a hydroxyl group toward the N5 similar to other oxidases is also unlikely to be oxidized by PaHNL1.

Intestinal microfold (M) cells are epithelial cells primarily present on Peyer's patches (PPs) in the small intestine. The ability of M cells to shuttle antigens into the PP for appropriate immune responses makes M cells a target for next-generation oral vaccine delivery. In this regard, discovery of M cell-specific receptors are of great interest, which could act as molecular tags for targeted delivery of cargo to M cells. Here, using a monoclonal antibody we generated to the Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin F (Siglec-F), we show that Siglec-F is expressed on mouse M cells in the small intestine. Immunohistochemical analysis of the PP tissue sections shows that Siglec-F is expressed on the surface of the M cell membrane exposed to the intestinal lumen. Anti-Siglec-F antibody injected into the mouse small intestine bound to M cells, demonstrating the potential to target M cells via Siglec-F.

Intestinal microfold (M) cells are small intestinal epithelial cells localized on the Peyer's patches (PPs) [1]. M cells actively transport luminal antigens from foods, viruses, and bacteria into the PPs, leading to induction of the appropriate immune response [2]. Because of the role of M cells in antigen transport, targeted delivery of antigens to M cells has been recognized as an approach to enhance oral vaccine efficacy [3]. Towards this end, several well-defined cell surface markers on M cells have been investigated as targets to deliver antigens to M cells. Targets investigated to date include α1-2 fucosylated glycans expressed on murine M cells that are recognized by the monoclonal antibody NKM16-2-4 [4], and glycoprotein 2 (GP2), an M cell specific protein that can be targeted with an anti-GP2 [5], [6]. Oral administration of antigen conjugated to either the NKM16-2-4 or anti-GP2 antibody, greatly elevated serum IgG and intestinal IgA responses, providing a proof of concept for an M cell-targeted oral vaccine [4], [5].

Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (Siglecs) are a family of proteins that recognize sialic acid residues on glycoproteins and glycolipids [7]. Siglecs were first characterized as immune cell receptors with functions including: regulation of cellular activation, tolerance induction, and pathogen recognition and uptake [7]. Recent studies, however, have revealed that several Siglecs are also expressed on non-immune cells, suggesting that Siglecs play roles beyond modulating immune cell responses. For example, Siglec-4 is well known to be expressed primarily on oligodendrocytes of the central nervous system [7], Siglec-6 in the placenta [8], Siglec-12 in the prostate and kidney [9], Siglec-5/14 on amniotic epithelium [10], and Siglec-5 on human M cells [11]. Due to their restricted expression pattern and efficient endocytic properties, Siglecs remain promising targets for delivering therapeutics to specific immune and non-immune cell types alike [12].

Siglec-F is a member of the Siglec family and was first identified as an eosinophil marker in mouse [7]. Siglec-F recognizes the NeuAcα2-3Gal[6S]β1-4GlcNAc motif printed on a synthetic glycan microarray [13], and it is proposed that binding of Siglec-F to a related glycan expressed on mouse lung potentiates eosinophil death in the lung during allergic asthma [14]. Accordingly, Siglec-F deficient mice exhibit increased numbers of lung-infiltrating eosinophils during an asthmatic state [15]. While these studies have established a suppressive function for Siglec-F on eosinophils, the role of Siglec-F in other cell-types, such as alveolar macrophages [16] and activated T cells [15], remains unclear.

We generated a monoclonal antibody recognizing Siglec-F to investigate its cell type expression and biological roles in mouse tissues and cells. Although attention to expression of Siglec-F has focused on immune cells in blood, spleen, and lymph nodes, we noted a single report of the presence of Siglec-F mRNA in mouse M cells [17]. As described here, we found that Siglec-F protein is indeed expressed on the luminal surface of small intestinal M cells. Furthermore, our Siglec-F antibody bound to M cells upon injection into the small intestine, demonstrating the potential of M cell targeting via Siglec-F.
C57BL/6J WT and Siglec-F KO (Mutant Mouse Resource Research Center, University of California Davis, USA) mice and Lewis rats were maintained in the specific pathogen free animal facility at The Scripps Research Institute (La Jolla, USA). C57BL/6J and Balb/c mice were maintained in the specific pathogen free animal facility at the University of East Anglia (Norwich, UK). Animal use in this study was in the accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of The Scripps Research Institute and the UK Home Office.
The anti-Siglec-F monoclonal antibody (rat IgG2b, clone 9C7) was generated as described previously [18]. Briefly, Lewis rats were immunized with Siglec-F-expressing CHO cells emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant (Difco Laboratories). Following two boosts of the cells emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (Difco Laboratories), the immunized rats were sacrificed and the common iliac lymph nodes were harvested to generate hybridomas. The established hybridomas were screened for reactivity to Siglec-F-CHO cells and Siglec-F-expressing HEK293 cells by flow cytometry. The selected anti-Siglec-F expressing hybridoma was grown for 7–10 days, and the antibody was purified from the culture supernatant and labelled with Alexa Fluor-647 (Life Technologies).
PPs were harvested from mouse small intestine and vortexed in PBS vigorously. The supernatant was removed, and this washing step was repeated three times. Washed PPs were incubated with 10 ml of PBS containing 5 mM EDTA and 1 mM DTT for 30 min at 37 °C, in order to remove cells localized in the epithelia. The solution was passed through a 40 μm-cell strainer and centrifuged. The harvested cells were incubated with FcR-blocking antibody (Biolegend, clone 93) and stained with anti-M cell antibody NKM16-2-4 (MP Biomedicals) for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by Biotin-labelled anti-rat IgG2c (Southern Biotech). The cells were further stained with a cocktail of Alexa647-labelled anti-Siglec-F antibody, Alexa700-labelled anti-mouse CD45 (Biolegend, clone: 30-F11), PE-labelled anti-mouse CCR3 (Biolegend, J073E5), PE-Cy7-labelled CD11b (Biolegend, M1/70), FITC-labelled UEA-I (Vector lab), and Pacific blue-labelled streptavidin (Life Technologies). The stained cells were washed and resuspended in 0.3 μg/ml propidium iodide for dead cell exclusion prior to analysis on Fortessa or LSR II cell analyzers (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed by FlowJo (Treestar).
Terminal ileum PPs were harvested from C57BL/6J mice, washed in 1x PBS, snap frozen in OCT (Bright CRYO-M-BED), and cryosectioned at 8-μm thickness. Sections were fixed for 5 min with −20 °C methanol, washed once with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 (PBS-T), and washed twice with PBS. All subsequent incubations were performed at RT. Sections were treated with 3% H2O2 in PBS for 30 min. After washing once with PBS-T and twice with PBS, slides were blocked with PBS containing 6% BSA and 10% normal mouse serum (Southern Biotech) for 30 min. Anti-mouse Siglec-F or isotype control (10 μg/ml) and UEA-I-FITC (20 μg/ml) were applied for 60 min. After washing, as described above, sections were incubated for 30 min with mouse anti-rat IgG2b-HRP (Southern Biotech, 2 μg/ml). Sections were washed once with PBS-T, washed four times with 1x PBS, and treated for 5 min with Cy-3 Plus TSA reagent (Perkin Elmer) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After washing once with PBS-T and four times with PBS, sections were incubated with anti-mouse M cell antibody NKM16-2-4 (25 μg/ml). After 60 min the slides were washed and treated with biotinylated anti-rat IgG2c (10 μg/ml) for 30 min, washed, and stained for 20 min with Alexa647 conjugated streptavidin and counterstained with DAPI (5 μg/ml). Sections were imaged with the Zeiss Axio Imager M2, and data were analyzed with ZEN 2 (blue edition).
Balb/c mice were anesthetized with a continuous flow of isoflurane. The small intestine was exposed via laparotomy, and an intestinal loop containing PPs was made using threads (Fig. 3A). Five micrograms of Alexa647-labelled anti-Siglec-F or isotype control antibody (Rat IgG2b, Biolegend) was injected into the loop. The mice were sacrificed 15 min after inoculation, and PPs were harvested. The Alexa647 signal associated with M cells was analyzed by flow cytometry.
In order to study Siglec-F expression profile on mouse tissues, we generated a monoclonal antibody to Siglec-F. Briefly, Lewis rats were immunized with Siglec-F expressing CHO cells. Hybridomas were established by fusing myeloma cell line with the lymphocytes from common iliac lymph nodes of the immunized animals. Hybridoma screening was performed based on the antibody reactivity to Siglec-F expressing CHO cells and HEK293 cells by flow cytometry. The established clone 9C7 produced a rat IgG2b monoclonal antibody, which binds to Siglec-F expressed on HEK293 cells (Fig. 1).

HEK 293 cells expressing Siglec-F or mock transfectant were stained with Alexa 647-labelled Siglec-F (Black) or isotype control (Grey) antibody. The stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Data are representative of two independent experiments with similar results.

3.2. Expression of Siglec-F on PP M cells
A report showing Siglec-F mRNA expression in mouse M cells [17] motivated us to investigate Siglec-F protein expression on mouse M cells using our Siglec-F monoclonal antibody (clone 9C7). PP M cells were identified as CD45−UEA-I+NKM16-2-4+ by flow cytometric analysis, as reported previously [17]. We found that PP M cells did indeed express Siglec-F when compared to an isotype control at levels comparable to eosinophils (CD45+CD11b+CCR3+) (Fig. 2A and B). Staining of M cells with the antibody clone 9C7 was specific for Siglec-F, since M cells isolated from Siglec-F KO mice stained at levels equivalent to the isotype control (Fig. 2B). In the immunohistochemical analysis, we found that Siglec-F staining was co-localized with the UEA-I and NKM16-2-4 signals in frozen sections of PP (Fig. 2C). Of note, Siglec-F expression was observed on the intestinal luminal surface of M cells (Fig 2C, arrows). Together these data demonstrate that Siglec-F is expressed on the luminal surface of mouse PP M cells.

(A) Cells isolated from the epithelial fraction of PPs were stained with anti-Siglec-F (Black) or isotype control (Grey) antibody together with the other cell surface markers. Stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Dead cells were excluded from the analysis by propidium iodide staining. (B) PPs from WT and Siglec-F KO mice were analyzed for their reactivity to the Siglec-F antibody clone 9C7 as in (A).

(C) Frozen sections of PPs were stained with anti-Siglec-F antibody, UEA-I, and NKM16-2-4. Blue signals show nuclear staining with DAPI. The bottom panels are enlarged images of the luminal side of PPs (white box). White arrows show the overlapping of the three signals. White bars in the top and bottom panel are 50 μm and 10 μm, respectively. Data are representative of at least two independent experiments with similar results.

3.3. In vivo M cell targeting by anti-Siglec-F antibody
To test whether M cells are targeted by Siglec-F antibody, Alexa647-labelled anti-Siglec-F or an isotype control antibody were injected intraluminally into a small intestine loop created by ligatures (Fig. 3A). PPs were harvested, and cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. We found that the Siglec-F antibody bound to M cells, but not to eosinophils - presumably because the eosinophils are not exposed to the intestinal lumen - demonstrating the potential of M cell targeting through Siglec-F via the intestinal lumen (Fig. 3B).

Our findings suggest a novel role for Siglec-F in M cells, opening up several key questions to be addressed; a) Since Siglec-F is well documented to have endocytic activity [19], to what extent might it contribute to the antigen transport by M cells? In this regard, Siglec-F has been shown to internalize the sialylated microbe Neisseria meningitides into the cell [19], suggesting a potential role for Siglec-F on M cells as a receptor for sialylated microorganisms in the gut. b) Is Siglec-F involved in survival of M cells? To determine whether the function of Siglec-F on M cells is analogous to its function in eosinophils, it will be important to test whether antibodies and glycan ligands toward Siglec-F also regulate the survival of M cells.

In humans, Siglec-8 is characterized as a functional paralogue of Siglec-F, exhibiting the same expression pattern and glycan-binding specificity [7]. Interestingly, Siglec-5 has been reported to be expressed in human M cells [11]. Therefore, it would be of interest to assess whether Siglec-5 and Siglec-F are functional paralogues on M cells.

In summary, we have identified Siglec-F expression on mouse M cells. The receptor can be targeted by antibody in vivo, which suggests that Siglec-F could potentially be exploited to deliver antigen to M cells. The discovery of Siglec receptors on both mouse (Siglec-F) and human (Siglec-5) M cells suggests a potentially conserved biological function for Siglecs in the gut.

During evolution, innate immunity has been tuned to recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns. However, some α-Proteobacteria are stealthy intracellular pathogens not readily detected by this system. Brucella members follow this strategy and are highly virulent, but other Brucellaceae like Ochrobactrum are rhizosphere inhabitants and only opportunistic pathogens. To gain insight into the emergence of the stealthy strategy, we compared these two phylogenetically close but biologically divergent bacteria.
In contrast to Brucella abortus, Ochrobactrum anthropi did not replicate within professional and non-professional phagocytes and, whereas neutrophils had a limited action on B. abortus, they were essential to control O. anthropi infections. O. anthropi triggered proinflammatory responses markedly lower than Salmonella enterica but higher than B. abortus. In macrophages and dendritic cells, the corresponding lipopolysaccharides reproduced these grades of activation, and binding of O. anthropi lipopolysaccharide to the TLR4 co-receptor MD-2 and NF-κB induction laid between those of B. abortus and enteric bacteria lipopolysaccharides. These differences correlate with reported variations in lipopolysaccharide core sugars, sensitivity to bactericidal peptides and outer membrane permeability.
The results suggest that Brucellaceae ancestors carried molecules not readily recognized by innate immunity, so that non-drastic variations led to the emergence of stealthy intracellular parasites. They also suggest that some critical envelope properties, like selective permeability, are profoundly altered upon modification of pathogen-associated molecular patterns, and that this represents a further adaptation to the host. It is proposed that this adaptive trend is relevant in other intracellular α-Proteobacteria like Bartonella, Rickettsia, Anaplasma, Ehrlichia and Wolbachia.
The class α-Proteobacteria includes microorganisms capable of establishing close associations with eukaryotic cells in a wide range of lifestyles. Members of the genus Agrobacterium are pericellular to plant cells and induce tumors, whereas Brucella, Bartonella, Phyllobacterium and Sinorhizobium are facultative extracellular-intracellular bacteria that behave as pathogens or endosymbionts, and Rickettsia, Anaplasma, Ehrlichia and Wolbachia are obligate intracellular pathogens of mammals and arthropods [1], [2]. Remarkably, animal pathogens of this group have the ability to avoid immediate recognition by innate immunity, thus following a stealthy strategy of which Brucella can be considered as a model [3]. In contrast, some bacteria close to Brucella are free living environmental microorganisms like Ochrobactrum, Daeguia, Crabtreella and Mycoplana. Although these four genera are included in the Brucellaceae (http://www.bacterio.cict.fr/), only Ochrobactrum has been reported to display some degree of pathogenicity. Ochrobactrum anthropi, primarily a rhizosphere inhabitant, has been isolated from immunocompromised individuals or patients subjected to dialysis, catheterization, surgical interventions or transplantation [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11] and often shows a broad antibiotic resistance [12], [13]. Ochrobactrum intermedium is another opportunistic member of the genus. Interestingly, Ochrobactrum is the Brucellaceae member closest to Brucella according to several molecular markers and genome comparisons [14].

Owing to its close phylogenetic relatedness with the highly virulent Brucella [15], Ochrobactrum has received some attention. Phenotypic analysis reveals that O. anthropi displays envelope molecules known to be critical in Brucella virulence. They include phosphatidylcholine and a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with a lipid A carrying very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA). Also, like other Brucellaceae, O. anthropi free lipids contain acyl chains with a higher number of carbons than those found in typical Gram negative bacteria. Along with the VLCFAs of lipid A, these structural features are thought to be relevant in the construction of a firm envelope which, in the case of Brucella, has been proposed to be important in pathogenicity [16], [17]. Despite these similarities, there are differences in important outer membrane properties. Most notably, while Brucella is highly permeable to hydrophobic substances and resistant to bactericidal cationic peptides, Ochrobactrum is impermeable and sensitive, albeit not to the same extent as typical Gram negative bacteria [18]. Interestingly, these differences have been correlated with some structural variations in the LPSs of these bacteria [18]. LPS typically bears a marked pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) and is thus a key target of innate immunity [19]. Indeed, the altered PAMP of Brucella LPS (BaLPS) greatly contributes to the stealthy strategy and virulence of this pathogen [3], [20]. All this evidence leads to the hypothesis that the Brucellaceae ancestors carried such molecules that without extensive remodeling resulted in features adequate to evade innate immunity [3].

To examine this possibility, we compared O. anthropi with Brucella abortus. We found that these bacteria display a significant divergence in the interaction with host cells and the innate immune system, and traced some of the differences to changes in orthologs of key Brucella virulence determinants. The results not only help to understand the widely different degrees of pathogenicity of these bacteria but also how intracellular pathogens following a stealthy strategy may have emerged in the α-Proteobacteria.
We first compared the replication of O. anthropi and B. abortus in mice after intraperitoneal injection, a route commonly used in virulence studies [21]. As expected, B. abortus reached high numbers one week after infection and maintained those numbers throughout the experiment, reflecting the chronic nature of brucellosis (Fig. 1A). O. anthropi, on the other hand, was recovered in four orders of magnitude and CFU numbers diminished throughout the experiment (Fig. 1A). However, under the conditions used, clearance was not complete, indicating some ability to persist. Although at 109 O. anthropi bacterial doses not deaths were recorded, piloerection and diarrhea were observed at 48 h after infection, suggesting moderate endotoxicity.
We then studied the ability of O. anthropi to invade and multiply in cells. For this, we first infected HeLa cells with O. anthropi or B. abortus and killed extracellular bacteria with gentamicin. Even at early times, O. anthropi was recovered in three orders of magnitude less than B. abortus, thus showing its inability to induce internalization (Fig. 1B). This was confirmed by intracellular-extracellular differential fluorescence, which showed that less that 0.1% of HeLa cells interacted with O. anthropi and that most of the visualized bacteria were located extracellularly. Moreover, whereas the CFU numbers of intracellular B. abortus increased throughout the experiment, those of O. anthropi declined steadily (Fig. 1B). In order to bypass the internalization deficiency and to determine if O. anthropi was able to multiply intracellularly, we used the Escherichia coli Cytotoxic Necrotizing Factor, a toxin that confers a phagocytic phenotype to HeLa cells [22]. This treatment increased the intracellular O. anthropi in one order of magnitude (Fig. 1B) and most visualized bacteria were intracellular. Nevertheless, O. anthropi was not able to achieve sustained replication, even though some survival was observed (Fig. 1B). Then, we repeated the experiments in Raw 264.7 murine macrophages. Although at early times the intracellular numbers of O. anthropi paralleled those of B. abortus, the replication curves coursed with opposite tendencies because, whereas B. abortus replicated, O. anthropi did not (Fig. 1C). Noteworthy, the later bacteria remained cultivable 48 h after infection (Fig. 1C). Altogether, these results indicate that O. anthropi possesses a very limited ability to invade and multiply intracellularly in cells.
We have shown that the cell envelopes of Brucella play a critical role in virulence [23], [24]. In part, this is due to some unusual physicochemical properties linked to peculiar lipids (i.e. phospholipids, ornithine lipids, LPS lipid A and lipoproteins) and to the properties of the periplasmic cyclic β-glucans. Moreover, the overall outer membrane protein profile [25] and some lipids [26] (Conde-Álvarez et al, unpublished) are under the control of the BvrR/BvrS system, a critical Brucella virulence regulator. Also, the envelope is the place where the type IV secretion system VirB is expressed. To contrast these Brucella features with those of O. anthropi, we first looked for the corresponding orthologs in genomic databases. O. anthropi carried orthologs of Brucella genes known to be involved in the synthesis of the periplasmic cyclic glucans, ornithine lipids, and phosphatidylcholine. Flagellin genes (coding for a PAMP-bearing protein) were present in O. anthropi and B. abortus, even though both predicted proteins are modified in the consensus sequence recognized by TLR5 [27]. In addition, B. abortus lipoprotein genes omp19, omp16 and omp10 had orthologs in O. anthropi. Other B. abortus putative lipoprotein ORFs were also present in O. anthropi, although the one encoded by open reading frame (ORF) BAB1_1548 carried a significant deletion encompassing 29 amino acids as compared to its ortholog. However, the converse was not true since orthologs of the putative lipoproteins corresponding to ORFs Oant_3560, Oant_1600, and Oant_2497 were not found in B. abortus (Table 1), suggesting a more simple lipoprotein profile in the cell envelope of the latter bacteria. Putative orthologous of genes coding for specialized acyltransferases and acylcarrier proteins (LpxXL and AcpXL) necessary to synthesize and incorporate VLFACs to lipid A were also present.
We then examined the presence and expression of the two component sensory-regulatory system BvrR/BvrS in O. anthropi. The predicted proteins of the consecutive ORFs Oant_0827 and Oant_0828 show 90.5% and 97.5% identity with BAB1_2092 (B. abortus BvrR) and BAB1_2093 (B. abortus BvrS), respectively. Primers designed on these sequences gave positive amplification reactions from both O. anthropi genomic DNA and cDNA, thus demonstrating transcription (Fig. 1D). In addition, an antibody against B. abortus BvrR readily detected a single band in O. anthropi lysates with a molecular weight consistent with that of the predicted protein (Fig. 1D).

Finally, we searched for orthologs of the type IV secretion system VirB. O. anthropi genome contains two DNA regions with an organization and identity compatible with the presence of a virB operon. The first one contains twelve consecutive ORFs (from Oant_674 to Oant_685) with an organization similar to that of the virB operon in B. abortus. With the exception of Oant_0679, which encodes a hypothetical protein of unknown function, all other ORFs have orthologs in the B. abortus virB operon, with percentage identities between the homologous predicted proteins ranging from 22.9% to 45.5%. In contrast, the second DNA region contains only seven ORFs (Oant_4564 to Oant_4562, Oant_4559 to Oant_4557 and Oant_4555) and the predicted proteins show a lower identity (from 18.1% to 35.1%) with the corresponding B. abortus VirB products. Primers designed on the sequences of the first DNA region for the virB4 (Oant_0677), virB5 (Oant_0678) and virB8 (Oant_0682) orthologs gave a positive amplification from O. anthropi genomic DNA and cDNA indicating their expression (Fig. 1D). Moreover, while the BvrR orthologous protein strongly reacted in Western blots, antibodies specific for B. abortus VirB8 showed only a weak band of the appropriate molecular weight in O. anthropi lysates (Fig. 1D). These results demonstrate the closer proximity between the BvrR/BvrS orthologs and indicate that in the Brucellaceae there is higher degree of divergence in the type IV secretion VirB systems committed to association with eukaryotic cells than in the BvrR/BvrS systems devoted to cell envelope homeostasis.
The initial phases of B. abortus infection are characterized by a negligible activation of proinflammatory mechanisms which contrasts with those triggered by most Gram negative pathogens [3]. We first tested to what extent this property was shared with O. anthropi. As shown in Fig. 2A, O. anthropi induced recruitment of leukocytes into the peritoneal cavity of mice, with more than a twofold increase in 24 hours. The analysis of these leukocytes indicated a rapid switch, with neutrophils increasing from 3% to more than 40% at two hours after intraperitoneal inoculation (Fig. 2B).
We also monitored the changes in blood after peritoneal inoculation in comparison with B. abortus and S. enterica. Although there was a quick initial decrease in the circulating leukocytes in the three cases, numbers remained low in mice inoculated with S. enterica. In contrast, there was a rapid return to basal levels in B. abortus inoculated mice and an intermediate phenotype, slightly closer to that of B. abortus, obtained with O. anthropi (Fig. 3A). The evaluation of the blood leukocyte populations showed a moderate change in the proportion of neutrophils in mice inoculated with B. abortus (Fig. 3B) and a rapid increase of the same cells in mice inoculated with S. enterica (Fig. 3C). Again, O. anthropi triggered an intermediate response (Fig. 3D).
The above results indicated that O. anthropi induces a cellular response compatible with acute bacterial infections and suggested that neutrophils could play a protective role. In addition, we previously observed that neutrophils do not play a significant role in B. abortus infections in mice [3]. Thus, we evaluated the relevance of these leukocytes in controlling O. anthropi using chronic neutropenic mice. Forty-eight hours after infection, all the neutropenic but none of the non-neutropenic mice were dead (Fig. 4A). The role of neutrophils in controlling O. anthropi was confirmed by the results of ex-vivo experiments with rat neutrophils (Fig. 4B).
Both Brucella cells and LPS are very poor complement activators [3]. To assess whether O. anthropi shares this property, we incubated rabbit serum with B. abortus and O. anthropi and then measured the lytic activity remaining in the supernatants using antibody-sensitized erythrocytes. Whereas B. abortus practically did not consume complement, O. anthropi completely abrogated the lytic activity, demonstrating an effective surface binding and the subsequent activation (Fig. 5A). Next, we tested the bactericidal activity of bovine serum against these bacteria. In agreement with the high avidity of the complement for the O. anthropi surface, this bacterium was considerable more susceptible to the bactericidal action of serum than B. abortus (Fig. 5B). Since LPS is one of the main molecules responsible for complement activation by Gram negative cell surfaces, we tested whether the O. anthropi LPS (OaLPS) consumed complement. Surprisingly, OaLPS was less effective than BaLPS in depleting complement activity, even both were less effective than the LPS from S. enterica (SeLPS) (Fig. 5C). Therefore, other O. anthropi surface molecules, such as capsule polysaccharides, may be responsible for binding complement.
Proinflammatory cytokines, particularly TNF-α, increase during acute Gram negative infections but not at the onset of brucellosis. When we studied this in comparative terms, we found that murine macrophages infected with O. anthropi released significantly higher amounts of TNF-α than cells infected with B. abortus (Fig. 6A), and this observation held true in vivo since mice displayed higher TNF-α blood levels when inoculated with O. anthropi than with B. abortus (Fig. 6B). O. anthropi, however, was not as efficient as S. enterica in the induction of TNF-α release in vivo (Fig. 6B).
Since LPS is the foremost PAMP-bearing molecule of Gram negative bacteria, we compared the ability of OaLPS, BaLPS, and E. coli LPS (EcLPS) to trigger cytokine responses in mice. OaLPS consistently induced higher blood levels of TNF-α, IL-1 and IL-10 than BaLPS (Fig. 7A–C) but lower than those induced by EcLPS, even if the latter was used at ten times less concentration (Fig. 7A–C). Consistent with these results, OaLPS induced a higher cytokine release in cultured macrophages than BaLPS (Fig. 7D insert). The induction of TNF-α release by OaLPS was TLR4- but not TLR2-dependent, because only macrophages derived from TLR4-knockout mice failed to release this cytokine (Fig. 7D). This pattern was similar to the induction of TNF-α by EcLPS, which also depended on TLR4 and not on TLR2 (Fig. 7D). Under the conditions used, the TNF-α levels produced by macrophages stimulated with BaLPS were significantly lower in both TLR2- and TLR4-deficient cells (Fig. 7D).
Dendritic cells are key elements linking innate and adaptive immunity. Since the evidence presented above situates the induction of innate immunity by O. anthropi between those elicited by enteric bacteria and B. abortus, we wanted to know whether this was also true in these cells. To this purpose, we measured the ability of the respective LPSs to trigger the formation of the dendritic cell aggregosome-like induced structures (DALIS) characteristic of the maturation of these cells. As expected, EcLPS induced more DALIS than BaLPS. Moreover, in keeping with all the above-described results, OaLPS displayed an activity that lay between BaLPS and EcLPS (Fig. 8A). To confirm this, we measured the expression of maturation markers in LPS-treated dendritic cells. As compared to BaLPS, OaLPS induced a significantly higher expression of surface CD40, CD80, CD86 and MHC-II which was, however, lower than that triggered by EcLPS (Fig. 8B).
Most biological effects of LPS depend on its interaction with the TLR4 co-receptor MD-2, an event that triggers a cascade of signals leading to the NF-κB-dependent activation of immune response genes. On the basis of the above-described results, we hypothesized that OaLPS would have a higher binding to MD-2 than BaLPS but lower than SeLPS, and that this would lead to an NF-κB activation between both types of LPSs. To test this possibility, we compared first the ability of OaLPS, BaLPS, and SeLPS to displace the hydrophobic probe bis-ANS from the binding site of human MD-2 (hMD2) [28]. We found that SeLPS was able to displace approximately 30% of bis-ANS from the hMD-2-binding site at concentrations from 1.25–5 µg/ml (Fig. 9A). Displacement by BaLPS, on the other hand, remained close to the background values obtained with an equal amount of water (Fig. 9A). At the highest concentration tested, OaLPS caused a displacement similar to that induced by SeLPS. However, at lower concentrations it approached the negligible values of BaLPS (Fig. 9A). The interaction with hMD-2 was also measured as the ability of the LPSs to block the recognition of hMD2 by anti-hMD-2 monoclonal antibody (Fig. 9B). SeLPS inhibited this antibody in a dose-dependent manner, with a 50% reduction in the signal at a concentration of 2 µg/ml. BaLPS did not reduce significantly the binding of the anti-hMD-2 antibody at any of the concentrations tested. Again, OaLPS showed an activity that laid between BaLPS and SeLPS since it blocked the antibody at concentrations higher than those of SeLPS (Fig. 9B). Finally, we assessed the activation of the terminal end of the signaling pathway by measuring the relative activity of a luciferase reporter under the control of the NF-κB promoter in HEK 293 cells transfected with expression vectors containing hMD-2, human TLR4 (hTLR4) and human CD14 (hCD14). As can be seen in Fig. 9C, ​,1010 to 25 times higher concentrations of OaLPS were necessary to generate a relative luciferase activity similar to that induced by 1 µg/ml of SeLPS. Consistent with other observations, BaLPS induced a weaker luciferase activity (Fig. 9C).
We proposed that B. abortus follows a stealthy strategy which relies on the absence, modification and inaccessibility of PAMP-bearing molecules behind a firm outer membrane [3]. A related hypothesis is that this pathogen has evolved from a free living α-Proteobacteria bacterium with envelope structural features already representing a first step towards innate immunity evasion [3], [18], [29]. According to this, the Brucella ancestor underwent further changes in such a structural scaffold upon contact with innate immunity effectors and, in parallel, reduced its genome, removed plasmids and trimmed-down its metabolic alternatives [30]. The results presented here reinforce these hypotheses in three ways: i), they show that the proinflammatory response to Brucella is significantly lower than that to the closest known neighbor bacteria which, significantly, is only an opportunistic pathogen; ii) they demonstrate the existence of envelope molecules prone to low recognition in Brucellaceae members that are primarily soil inhabitants and; iii) they support the notion that relatively few and not drastic structural changes in a key PAMP-bearing molecule result in very different lifestyles.

The early clinical evolution of human brucellosis is characterized by a negligible pro-inflammatory response [31], a phenomenon reproduced in experimental models [3]. In contrast, O. anthropi infection triggered leukocytosis, neutrophilia, platelet aggregation and acute fever [32], [33], all indicative of sepsis. The relevance of this response in O. anthropi infections is best exemplified by the prominent role played by neutrophils. These cells were bactericidal for O. anthropi and their absence converted an otherwise harmless microbe into a lethal pathogen. This agrees with the opportunistic character of O. anthropi and sets a clear cut limit with brucellosis, where neutrophils do not seem to play a significant role in controlling the infection [3]. It is tempting to speculate that conserved molecules involved in Brucella virulence like phosphatidylcholine, the VLCFA in lipoproteins and lipid A, the periplasmic cyclic glucans, and the orthologous BvrR/BvrS and VirB systems [34], [35], [36] participate in this survival. In the natural environment of Ochrobactrum, these structures and systems may be related to resistance to antibiotic peptides, osmotic stress, the transference of plasmids, survival against protozoan predation, or other modes of interaction with eukaryotic cells of the rhizosphere [4], [37].

Similarly to the proinflammatory response, It is striking that the adaptive immune response provoked by O. anthropi also lies between that induced by typical extracellular and intracellular pathogens [38]. Indeed, while Brucella infection is characterized by a protective Th1 immune response [39], O. anthropi infection stimulates a mix of Th1 and Th2 type response which does not protect against Brucella [38]. However, when switched to a Th1-biased response by addition of the TLR9 agonist unmethylated CpG, O. anthropi induces some protection against Brucella. Since protection against Brucella is dependent on TLR9 and Myd88 [40], [41] and, since unmethylated CpG is not accessible unless envelopes are breached, then the toughness of the Brucella envelope should play an important role in the stealthy behavior. The results presented here and previously [18] evidences this and demonstrates that O. anthropi differs from Brucella in crucial envelope properties.

It is feasible to propose that Brucella ancestors had already envelope molecules displaying determinants that departure from the PAMPs targeted by innate immunity receptors. Since PAMPs are conserved because they are functionally essential, one may ask why this departure from the canonical structure was possible in the Brucellaceae, and what kind of selective forces were behind it. In most Proteobacteria, cell envelopes are impermeable to a large variety of noxious substances through the combined action of outer leaflet characteristics that do not allow the partition of hydrophobic substances, a property linked to the high density of negatively charged groups in the outer membrane [42], [43]. This leads to the conservation of those groups and, consequently, to their ready recognition as PAMPs by innate immunity, as illustrated by the wide array of bactericidal peptides that exert their action upon binding to the negative charged groups in core and lipid A.

Whereas O. anthropi keeps the permeability barrier, Brucella does not and is concomitantly less sensitive to bactericidal peptides [18]. Significantly, this property also lays between the high resistance of Brucella envelopes and the sensitivity of enterobacterial envelopes to bactericidal cationic peptides [18]. This shows that Brucella and O. anthropi represent a lineage endowed with outer membranes and LPSs with some degree of resistance to bactericidal peptides and, since the primary habitat of most Brucellaceae is the soil, it is likely that this property resulted from the selective pressure of antibiotic peptides produced by soil microorganisms. However, in Brucella the permeability barrier to which sensitivity to bactericidal peptides is linked, is no longer necessary to confront mucosal surfaces or intracellular environments. Therefore, this property could have been relinquished by the Brucella ancestor, keeping and increasing its resistance to host bactericidal peptides.

An analysis of the respective LPSs, supports above developed hypotheses (Fig. 10). The similarity of the biological activity of the BaLPS and OaLPS makes unlikely that the respective O-chains play a significant role since they are very different structures [44], [45] and, at least for B. abortus there is evidence for horizontal acquisition [46]. On the other hand, the VLCFAs of both bacteria represent a first departure of the canonical lipid A structure (Fig. 10) that seems ancestral in α-2 Proteobacteria [47]. Since VLCFAs carry an hydroxyl group at the iso position and are postulated to span the outer membrane [47], they could provide a firm anchorage that contributes to explain the integrity of the outer membranes observed in the polymyxin B binding experiments [18]. Detail core structures have not been elucidated for any Brucella species or O. anthropi, but the available information on the Brucella closer relative O. intermedium and on the sugar and lipid compositions in B. abortus and O. anthropi also shows a departure from enteric bacteria, with a comparatively lower number of negatively charged groups (Fig. 10). Moreover, quantitative analysis suggests a further charge reduction in Brucella LPS core that is consistent with the loss of the permeability barrier and its greater resistance to bactericidal peptides (Fig. 10).

The departure from the canonical PAMP in both the VLCFAs of lipid A and in the negatively charged groups of the lipid A-core of Ochrobactrum, enhanced further in B. abortus, is in agreement with the results of the LPS-hMD-2 binding experiments. MD-2 comprises a hydrophobic pocket and some cationic domains that correspond to two functional types of LPS recognition sites, one for the lipid A portion and the other for the anionic groups [28], [48], [49]. In the case of the lipid A, it would be impossible to accommodate all acyl chains, particularly VLCFA, into the hydrophobic pocket of MD-2. A model of TLR4 activation, that suggests that the secondary acyl chain of the lipid A protrudes out of the MD-2 pocket and directly interacts with hydrophobic side chains of TLR4 (F440 and F463), diving the receptor dimerization and activation, has been suggested [50]. In case of OaLPS we propose that the VLCFA interact directly with TLR4, and in this case the terminal hydroxyl group increases its propensity to be exposed to the solvent. The key requirement for activation of TLR4.MD-2 complex is the delivery of monomeric LPS, by LBP and CD14, which may also be determined by the LPS core, which differs between the Ochrobactrum and Brucella LPSs (Fig. 10). Since these LPS structures are rooted in the phylogeny of the group, this illustrates how relatively few structural changes on an orthologous structure may contribute to adaptation to widely different lifestyles.

Not all properties of O. anthropi were related to LPS. The complete bacterium readily consumed complement and was killed by serum, but its LPS did not trigger the lytic cascade. Consequently, differences in other surface structures, such as O. anthropi lipoproteins or extracellular polysaccharides [51], should be responsible for complement activation and the ensuing proinflammatory activities. Bacterial capsular polysaccharides have been shown to consume complement and stimulate cytokine production through TLR activation [52], [53], [54].

Animal pathogenic α-Proteobacteria have molecules not readily recognized by innate immunity, and these bacteria also tend to establish chronic infections [55], [56], [57], [58], [59]. For instance, Bartonella possesses a low agonist non-canonical lipid A with VLCFA, a low number of lipoproteins and flagella not recognized by TLR5 [27], [59], [60]. In Rickettsia, there is an absence of flagella a reduced number of lipoproteins and a non-canonical LPS [61], [62]. The insect Wolbachia parasites do not posses LPS, flagellum, fimbria or pili, and contain a low number of lipoproteins and an unusual peptidoglycan [63]. Intracellular Ehrlichia and Anaplasma have low number of lipoproteins and do not have LPS, peptidoglycan or flagellin [64], [65]. Therefore it seems plausible that the α-Proteobacteria intracellular pathogen ancestor may have been endowed with structures prone to low recognition. In addition, animals could have developed an innate immune repertoire that preferably recognizes β and γ-Proteobacteria rather than α-Proteobacteria molecular patterns. In the case of Brucella, it is possible that evolutionary pressures linked to innate immunity forced for the selection of organisms displaying low PAMPs recognition [66]. The selective forces working in the second scenario could be linked to the early endosymbiotic relationship between eukaryotic cells and α-Proteobacteria ancestors [67] which would have led to the identification of some bacterial molecules as “self” in relation to those of β and γ-Proteobacteria, which appeared later in evolution [68]. It is worth noting, however, that all these α-Proteobacteria have orthologous type IV secretion systems, which seem to be essential for controlling the intracellular survival.

We propose that, Brucella evolved from an opportunistic pathogen, non markedly endotoxic ancestor within a mammal environment [30], [69] by: i), removing microbial molecular determinants such as capsules and fimbriae; ii), modifying surface molecules such as flagella, lipoproteins and LPS to provide high resistance to bactericidal cationic substances and complement and, concomitantly, avoid recognition by TLRs; iii), keeping structures such as peptidoglycan and unmethylated DNA under a tough envelope; and iv), maintaining the regulatory systems (e.g. BvrR-BvrS) that control the homeostasis of an outer membrane whose overall structure is essential in the interaction with the host. This furtive strategy, which also required a remodeling of ancestral type IV secretion systems to sneak and reproduce in cells, does not preclude the development of determinants actively hampering the activation of immunity at later stages [70], [71], [72].

Finally, the recorded phenotypic, biological and pathogenic differences between Brucella and Ochrobactrum, strengthens arguments for maintaining these two bacterial clusters as separate genera in the Brucellaceae and reinforce the concept that non-drastic molecular variations generate marked divergences that result in different biological groups.
All animals were handled and sacrificed according to the approval and guidelines established by the “Comité Institucional para el Cuido y Uso de los Animales of the Universidad de Costa Rica”, and in agreement with the corresponding law “Ley de Bienestar de los Animales No 7451” of Costa Rica (http://www.protecnet. go.cr/salud). The recommendations stated in the Weatherall report “The use of non-human primates in research” (http://www.mrc.ac.uk/Utilities/Documentrecord/index.htm?d=MRC003440), were followed accordingly.
Salmonella enterica sv. typhimurium strain SL1344, virulent B. abortus 2308, and O. anthropi LMG 3331T have been previously described [1], [45], [73]. BaLPS, OaLPS, SeLPS and EcLPS were purified and characterized as previously described [18], [24]. S. enterica (strainHL83) LPS was provided by K. Brandenburg (Forschungszentrum Borstel, Germany). E. coli CNF was purified as previously described [22]. BvrR was cloned as glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion protein in pGEX-2TK vector, expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3), and purified following standard protocols. Rabbit anti-BvrR antibodies were produced by four intramuscularly applied boosts of GST-BvrR (250 µg) in complete (first boost) or incomplete (second to fourth boost) Freund adjuvant (Sigma-Aldrich Co.). Antibodies from 2 ml of serum were adsorbed to GST-BvrR-Sepharose beads, eluted with 0.2 M glycine, pH 2.5, and collected in 1 M Tris, pH 9,0. The antibodies were concentrated by ultrafiltration and stored at -20°C in 50% glycerol. The anti-Ochrobactrum antibody was produced in a rabbit by 4 boosts of intramuscular injections of formaldehyde fixed bacteria. The specificity of the antibody was confirmed by immunofluorescence against a panel of related α-Proteobacteria. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits for cytokine determination were from BD Biosciences (San Diego, CA.). Monoclonal antibody RB6-8C5 against murine granulocytes was a gift from Bärbel Raupach, MPIIB, Berlin, Germany. Allophycocyanin conjugated-anti-CD11c antibody (HL3) and phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CD40, -CD80, -CD86, and -MHC class II were all from Pharmingen. Mouse antibody FK2 (Biomol) was provided by D. Williams (University of Toronto). The properties and reactivity of anti-VirB8 antibody have been described before [74].
The characteristics, source and maintenance of Balb/c, C57BL/6 and the KO counterparts TLR4−/− and TLR2−/−, mice have been described previously [3], [72]. Generation of neutropenic mice was performed as described before [3]. For calculating the bacterial multiplication rates in spleens, groups of 20 eight-week-old female BALB/c were intraperitoneally inoculated with 0.1 ml of a suspension of the indicated bacteria species. Animals for each group were killed by cervical dislocation at appropriate times. Spleens were aseptically removed and individually homogenized in 1 ml PBS. Dilutions from this homogenate were seeded on TSA and CFU numbers determined. Alternatively mice were inoculated with 0.1 ml (pyrogen-free sterile PBS) of the indicated LPS preparation by the intraperitoneal route. Wistar rats were maintained in the animal facility of the Veterinary School of the National University, Costa Rica. Cytokine or leukocyte counts were performed in the peritoneum and blood of infected or LPS inoculated mice as described previously [3].
Human cervix carcinoma cells (HeLa; American Type Culture Collection No. CCL-2) were grown at 37°C under 5% CO2 in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 2.5% sodium bicarbonate and 1% glutamine (all from Gibco, Inc.). Murine macrophages (Raw 264.7; American Type Culture Collection No. TIB-71) were grown at 37°C under 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2.5% sodium bicarbonate and 1% glutamine (all from Gibco). Penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 µg/ml) routinely added, were excluded from cell cultures during Ochrobactrum and Brucella infections. Before infection, 24-well-plates monolayers were washed in PBS and kept at 4°C. Infections were carried out using cultures of O. anthropi or B. abortus in logarithmic phase diluted in Eagle's minimal essential medium to reach the desired multiplicities of infection (MOI). Plates were centrifuged at 300×g at 4°C, incubated for 30 min at 37°C under 5% CO2 and washed 3 times with PBS. Extracellular bacteria were killed by adding Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 100 µg/ml gentamicin for 1 h for B. abortus or 4 h for O. anthropi. Cells were further incubated for the indicated times in the presence of 5 µg/ml gentamicin for B. abortus or 100 µg/ml gentamicin for O. anthropi. Plates were then washed with PBS. Cells were lyzed with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Aliquots were diluted and plated in tryptic soy agar and incubated at 37°C for determination of CFU. For immunofluorescence experiments HeLa cells or Raw 264.7 macrophages grown on 12 mm glass slides were inoculated with B. abortus or O. anthropi as described above and kept in the presence of gentamicin for the indicated times. After incubation cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde-PBS and free aldehyde groups were quenched with 50 mM NH4Cl-PBS. After permeabilization with 0.5% Triton-PBS, total bacteria were labeled with rabbit anti-Ochrobactrum antibodies followed by TRITC conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies.
Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy and flow cytometry of LPS treated murine bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDC) were performed as described before [72]. Briefly, paraformaldehyde fixed cells processed by immunofluorescence were examined on a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope for image acquisition. Antibody against a conserved cytoplasmic epitope found on MHC-II I-Aβ which strongly labels BMDC but not macrophages was used throughout the experiments. For confirmation of the dendritic cell phenotype, double labeling with anti- MHC-II and anti-CD11c antibody was performed. Quantification was always done by counting at least 100 cells in 4 independent experiments, for a total of at least 400 host cells analyzed. DALIS BMDC were collected and stained immediately before fixation. Isotype controls were included as well as BMDC non-LPS treated as control for autofluorescence. Cells were always gated on CD11c for analysis and at least 100000 events were collected to obtain a minimum of 10000 CD11c positive events for analysis. A FACS calibur cytometer (Becton Dickinson) was used and data was analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star).
The different bacterial strains were grown to exponential phase in TSB at 37°C. The bacteria were concentrated by centrifugation (10000×g, 10 min), resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer [75] and heated at 100°C for 20 min. Protein concentration was determined by BioRad DC method according to the manufacturer's instructions and equal amounts of protein (20 µg) were loaded onto a 12.5% gel for SDS-PAGE. Separated proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane and probed with the indicated antibodies. Membranes were further incubated with peroxidase conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies and the detected bands were visualized by chemiluminescence reaction exposed to X-ray films.
Genomic DNA was isolated by CTAB method according to standard procedures [76]. Specific amplification from gDNA or cDNA was achieved with the following primers designed after analysis of O. anthropi genome: for locus Oant_0677: oantvirB4f GGATTACACCGTGACCTCAAC and oantvirB4r GCCTGATAACATGCGTCCATAA; for locus Oant_0678: oantvirB5.3 CGATGCTCTTCATCAGCAGATTGAG, oantvirB5.5 CTTTGCGACATCCGCCATATC; for locus Oant_0682: oantvirB8.3 GATCAAGACCGCATGATTCAGG, oantvirB8.5 GTCACGGCTTCGTCGTAAGTG. For amplification of gDNA or cDNA encoding putative bvrR and bvrS, the following primers were used: for Oant_0827 (bvrS): oantbvrS.3 GCATTCTCTACATGAATCAGTTCC and oantbvrS.5 GTGATGGCGTCAGGCTTTG. And for Oant_0828 (bvrR): oantbvrR.3 GACGACGACCGCAACATCCTG and oantbvrR.5 CGAAGATCGCAAGATTGGGC. Positive controls of amplification of genomic DNA or cDNA were achieved using a pair of primers oantl12.3 CTGTCGGCACTGACCGTTCTCG and oantl12.5 CGCCACCAGCAGCAGCAACTG interrogating locus Oant_1946, encoding the ribosomal protein L7/L12. Cycling conditions were: 94°C for 4 min, 30 cycles at 94°C for 30 s, 50 or 65°C for 1 minute and 68°C for 30 seconds and continued with a 68°C incubation for 10 minutes. The PCR products were analyzed on agarose gels using standard procedures. For RNA extraction bacterial cultures were adjusted to 109 CFU/ml and disrupted with 0.5% Zwittergent 3–16 at 37°C for 1 h. Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Midi Kit (Qiagen, Co.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Eluted RNA was treated with Ambion Turbo DNAse following the robust protocol. Synthesis of cDNA was carried out using Revert Aid M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase with random hexamers and following manufacturers' Instructions. (Fermentas). The obtained cDNA was used as template for detection of the genes mentioned above by PCR using the same primers described. Minus RT controls were performed using RNA samples during PCR.
Complement consumption was estimated as previously described [77], [78]. Briefly, rabbit serum was incubated with live packed bacteria or LPS for 30 min at 37°C. After incubation, the complement activity on the serum was detected as the ability to lyze sheep erythrocytes pre-sensitized with guinea pig anti-sheep antibodies. For the estimation of complement bactericidal activity, exponentially growing bacteria were adjusted to 104 CFU/ml in saline and dispensed in triplicate in microtiter plates (45 µl per well) containing fresh normal bovine serum (90 µl/well). After 90 min of incubation at 37°C, brain heart infusion broth was dispensed (200 µl/well), mixed with the bacterial suspension and 100 µl was plated on TSA. Results were expressed as the percentage of CFU with respect to the inoculums in three assays.
Binding of LPS to MD-2 was assayed by two different methods: displacement of bis-ANS from hMD-2 by LPS, and binding to hMD-2 by competitive enzyme linked-immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Recombinant hMD-2 was produced in E. coli and isolated as described before [79]. In both assays, LPS was subjected to three cycles of heating at 56°C followed by cooling to 4°C, left over night and sonicated before using. Binding of bis-ANS to hMD-2 was measured at 20°C using excitation at 385 nm and measuring the emission fluorescence spectra between 420 and 550 nm. Then, from 5 to 80 µl of a LPS stock at 0.125 mg/ml was added (controls were prepared with the same volume of water) to preincubated bis-ANS/hMD-2 complex (50 nM/50 nM). The F0 value was the fluorescence of bis-ANS/hMD-2 complexes after 5 min of incubation (to reach stable fluorescence).The FLPS value was the fluorescence after LPS addition to the complex. Fluorescence was measured on Perkin Elmer fluorimeter LS 55. Quartz glass cuvettes (5×5 and 10×5 mm optical path, Hellma Suprasil) were used and bis-ANS was obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, Missouri, U.S.A.). The ELISA for determination of LPS binding to hMD-2 was performed in 96-well plates (NUNC immunoplate F96 cert. Maxi-sorp, Roskilde, Denmark). Chicken polyclonal anti-hMD-2 (GenTel, Madison, WI, U.S.A) (5 µg/ml) in 50 mM Na2CO3 (pH 9.6) was used to coat the microtiter plate at 4°C overnight. Excess binding sites were blocked with 1% BSA in PBS buffer (pH 7.2) for 1 h at room temperature, and rinsed three times with the same buffer. During the blocking step, hMD-2 (0.75 µM) was preincubated with 0 µg/ml to 20 µg/ml LPS at 37°C and, as a negative control, LPS was also preincubated in absence of hMD-2. These solutions were added to the plate, which was then incubated for 1 h at 37°C. After rinsing, only hMD-2 without LPS was detected by incubation with 0.1 µg/ml of mouse monoclonal anti-hMD-2 (clone 9B4 e-Bioscience San Diego, CA., U.S.A.) in PBS buffer at 37°C for 1 h, followed by incubation with 0.1 µg/ml peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz, CA., U.S.A.), also in PBS buffer at 37°C for 1 h. After plate washing, ABTS (Sigma) was added, the reaction was stopped with 1% SDS after 15 min, and the absorbance at 420 nm measured using a Mithras LB940 apparatus. (Berthold Technologies). S. enterica (strainHL83) LPS, used as a control.

Stimulation of NF-κB transcription by purified LPS. HEK293 cells (ATCC CRL-1573) were transiently transfected with 3 ng hTLR4, 6 ng hMD-2, 5 ng hCD14 expression vectors, 50 ng of NF-κB or IP-10 promoter dependent luciferase reporter, and 5 ng constitutive Renilla reporter plasmids, using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 6 h, media were changed to Dulbeccos's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and different amounts of LPS were added to the cells. As a negative control, we used cells transfected with the same plasmids but without addition of LPS. After 20 h, cells were lyzed and analyzed for reporter gene activities using a dual luciferase reporter assay system on a Mithras LB940 apparatus (Berthold Technologies). The data of luciferase activity were normalized using Renilla luciferase readings.
Student's t test for was used for determining the statistical significance in the different assays. For bacterial colonization experiments, the Mann-Whitney test was performed accordingly (http://faculty.vassar.edu/lowry/utest.html).

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age and is commonly complicated by adverse endometrial outcomes. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of non-protein-coding transcripts that are more than 200 nucleotides in length. Accumulating evidence indicates that lncRNAs are involved in the development of various human diseases. Among these lncRNAs, lncRNA CD36–005 (CD36–005) is indicated to be associated with the pathogenesis of PCOS. However, the mechanisms of action of CD36–005 have not yet been elucidated.
This study determined the CD36–005 expression level in the uteri of PCOS rat model and its effect on the proliferation activity of rat primary endometrial stromal cells. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and bioinformatics analysis were performed to detect the mRNA expression profiles and the biological pathways in which these differentially expressed mRNAs involved, after CD36–005 overexpression in the primary endometrial stromal cells. The differential expression of Hmgn5, Nr5a2, Dll4, Entpd1, Fam50a, and Brms1 were further validated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).
CD36–005 is highly expressed in the uteri of PCOS rat model and promotes the proliferation of rat primary endometrial stromal cells. A total of fifty-five mRNAs differentially expressed were identified in CD36–005 overexpressed stromal cells. Further analyses identified that these differentially expressed mRNAs participate in many biological processes and are associated with various human diseases. The results of qRT-PCR validation were consistent with the RNA-seq data.
These data provide a list of potential target mRNA genes of CD36–005 in endometrial stromal cells and laid a foundation for further studies on the molecular function and mechanism of CD36–005 in the endometrium.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common and complex endocrine disorders in women of reproductive age, with a prevalence estimated to be 5–10% [1–4]. The clinical features of PCOS are highly heterogeneous. Patients with PCOS have reproductive dysfunction and metabolic abnormalities, and are commonly characterized by persistent ovulatory disorder, ovarian polycystic morphology, hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance (IR), hyperinsulinemia, and obesity [5, 6]. In addition, in women with PCOS, the risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, infertility, and some adverse endometrial outcomes increases [7–11]. The diversity of the clinical features of PCOS is attributed to the multifactorial contribution on its pathogenesis, including complex genetic and environmental factors [12]. Patients with PCOS often have endometrial abnormalities and most are anovulatory or oligo ovulatory. However, after the anovulation or oligo ovulation is treated, they still have lower pregnancy rates and higher spontaneous miscarriage rates, which suggest the decrease of their endometrial receptivity [10, 13]. Additionally, patients with PCOS have a significantly higher risk of having endometrial hyperplasia and developing endometrial cancer [11]. These adverse endometrial outcomes are associated with the metabolic abnormalities of PCOS including chronic unopposed estrogen, IR, hyperinsulinemia, hyperandrogenism, and obesity, and complex genetic alterations [11, 14]. However, the underlying mechanisms of PCOS in the uterus are still unclear.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are defined as a class of non-coding transcripts with the length of more than 200 nucleotides. Although lncRNAs lack the capacity to code for proteins, they can regulate gene expression at epigenetic, transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and other levels [15]. lncRNAs are proven to play key roles in many biological processes, including genetic imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, gene transcription regulation, organelle biogenesis, and subcellular trafficking [16]. Dysfunctional lncRNAs contribute to the pathogenesis of many human diseases, such as diabetic nephropathy, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, cardiomyopathy, atherosclerosis, and cancers in various systems [17–21]. The role of lncRNAs in the pathogenesis of several endometrial diseases has also been reported in recent studies, including implantation failure or spontaneous miscarriage, endometrial hyperplasia, adenomyosis, endometriosis, and endometrial cancer [11, 22–24]. However, we knew little about the role of lncRNAs in the pathogenesis of adverse endometrial outcomes of PCOS.

In our previous research, we found that lncRNA CD36–005 (CD36–005) was significantly upregulated in the ovaries of PCOS rat model by lncRNA expression profile analysis [25]. After determining that CD36–005 is also highly expressed in the uteri of PCOS rat model in the present study, we suggest that the upregulation of CD36–005 expression might be associated with the pathogenesis of PCOS in the uterus. We used primary endometrial stromal cells from rat uteri as the in-vitro model, and performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology and bioinformatics analyses after CD36–005 overexpression to investigate its potential role from a more comprehensive perspective. We also conducted CCK-8 assay to determine the effect of CD36–005 on the proliferation activity of stromal cells, which is the first step of decidualization. Our results provide insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms of CD36–005 in the regulation of endometrial stromal cells and the pathogenesis of adverse endometrial outcomes of PCOS.
All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Jilin University, and were conducted in accordance with the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Mature female Wistar rats (8 weeks old) were purchased for the isolation of primary endometrial stromal cells in the present study.
The uterine tissue used in this study was collected from the PCOS rat model in the article “Expression profiles of mRNA and long noncoding RNA in the ovaries of letrozole-induced polycystic ovary syndrome rat model through deep sequencing [25].” The middle of the uteri (body of uterus) was collected for subsequent total RNA extraction.
Primary endometrial stromal cells were isolated from 8-week-old Wistar rats’ uteri using previously described methods, cultured with DMEM-nutrient mixture F-12 Ham (DMEM-F12, Hyclone, USA) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, USA), and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 [26].
Stromal cells were seeded on coverslips and washed with phosphate buffer saline (PBS, Hyclone, USA). Then, the confluent cells were fixed in cold methanol, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and blocked with 1% goat serum. Stromal cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit anti-mouse monoclonal antibody specific to vimentin and cytokeratin-19 at a 1:200 dilution in PBS (Boster, Wuhan, China) [27–29]. In order to validate the specificity of vimentin antibody, 5% nonimmune goat serum was used as negative control. After washed by PBS three times, stromal cells were incubated with goat-anti-rabbit second antibody (Boster, Wuhan, China) for 2 h at room temperature. Finally, coverslips were rinsed and mounted with DAPI. The stained stromal cells were observed using Olympus IX71 fluorescence microscope and images were analyzed by using cellSens Dimension.
When stromal cells reached 70% confluency, they were transiently transfected with either Ad-CD36–005 or Ad-GFP designed by Hanbio Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) at the designated multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 50. The full-length sequence of CD36–005 was directly cloned into the pHBAD-EF1-MCS-3flag-CMV-GFP vector by seamless cloning. After 6 h incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2, the medium was replaced with fresh growth medium. After transfection with Ad-CD36–005 or Ad-GFP, the stromal cells were collected at 48 h.

The small-interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes for targeting CD36–005, as well as a scrambled sequence (control siRNA duplex, negative control) were synthesized by the RiboBio Company (Guangzhou, China). The sequences were shown as follows: 5’-UAAGGACCUCUAUUGCUUGTT and CAAGCAAUAGAGGUCCUUATT (CD36–005 siRNA); 5’-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUTT and 5’-ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAATT (nonspecific scrambled siRNA, negative control). Transfections for siRNA were performed according to Fugene HD Transfection Reagent (Promega, USA) protocol. After transfection with CD36–005 or control siRNA, stromal cells were collected at 36 h.
CCK-8 reagent (Promega, USA) was used to perform the proliferation assays according to the manufacturer’s directions. Stromal cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 105 /well in 96-well plates and cultured in the DMEM/F12 medium containing 2% heat-inactivated FBS. After transfection with Ad-CD36–005, Ad-GFP, or CD36–005 siRNA, the stromal cells were cultured for 48 h. Finally, cells in each well were added with 10 μl of CCK-8 reagent and incubated for 2 h. Absorbance was measured at 490 nm using a 96-well plate reader.
Total RNA from the middle of the uteri and stromal cells were extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen/Life Technologies, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The concentration and quality of RNA were determined using NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, UK) to ensure that the OD260/280 absorbance ratios of all samples were between 1.8 and 2. RNA integrity was evaluated using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, USA).
RNA samples from three stromal cells in each group with RNA Integrity Number (RIN) ≥ 7 were subjected to the subsequent mRNA sequencing by Shanghai OE Biotech Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The libraries were constructed using TruSeq Stranded mRNA LTSample Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. These libraries were sequenced on the Illumina sequencing platform (HiSeqTM 2500 or Illumina HiSeq X Ten) and 125 bp/150 bp paired-end reads were generated. We used Gene Ontology (GO) to categorize the function of the differentially expressed mRNAs and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) to predict the signaling pathways in which these differentially expressed mRNAs may be involved.
Reverse transcription reactions were performed using PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit (Takara Bio) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analyses were performed at the following conditions: 95 °C for 2 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 59 °C for 30 s, according to the instructions of SYBR Premix Ex Taq (TaKaRa). The mRNAs and lncRNA CD36–005 were normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and the relative expression levels were analyzed by calculating the fold changes using the 2−ΔΔCt value method. We purchased the primer sequences for qRT-PCR from RiboBio Company (Guangzhou, China).
Significance of difference between two groups was compared by Independent-Samples T Test. Data are shown mean ± SEM. Significance of difference was considered significant at P < 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS17.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago).
Quality control of primary endometrial stromal cell cultures
The purity of the primary endometrial stromal cells was assessed using the difference in vimentin and cytokeratin expression. The absence of primary antibody was used as a negative control. Results of cell immunofluorescence show that the purity of endometrial stromal cells was more than 90%, which can be used for subsequent experiments (Fig. 1).

Accumulating evidence shows that the endocrinal and metabolic disorders of PCOS have complex effects on the endometrium, leading to endometrial abnormalities [11, 14]. The endometrium is a steroid hormone-targeting tissue that undergoes cyclic secretion and proliferation dynamically in response to estrogen and progesterone produced by the ovaries [30]. Because most patients with PCOS are anovulatory or oligo ovulatory, the endometrium is continuously stimulated by unopposed estrogen in the absence of the regulatory effects of progesterone, which decrease the endometrial receptivity and promote the development of endometrial hyperplasia and even cancer in the long run [11]. In addition, patients with PCOS often have IR and obesity [6]. Insulin levels in the local endometrium affect the endometrial development and receptivity. IR can cause hyperglycemia, which further aggravates hyperandrogenism [14]. These are all high risk factors of endometrial cancer [11]. The pathogenesis of PCOS and its abnormal endometrial outcomes is a multifactorial biological process that involves a large number of genes and biological pathways, among which the role of lncRNAs has been studied in recent years [22, 31].

Owing to the abundance but low expression level of lncRNAs, they were initially considered to be transcriptional noise without any biological function [32]. With the rapid development of genomics and transcriptomics technology, researchers gradually found the regulatory role of lncRNAs in various human diseases [17]. In accumulating studies, only a few lncRNAs have been reported to be associated with both PCOS and various endometrial disorders. The expression of steroid receptor RNA activator (SRA) as well as lncRNA CTBP1-AS, a novel androgen receptor modulator, was significantly higher in peripheral blood leukocytes of women with PCOS. Meantime, it is known that women with PCOS show dysregulated hormone receptors expression, suggesting us a potential role of genes modulating hormone receptors in PCOS-associated endometrial disorders [33–35]. However, the functions and underlying mechanisms of these dysregulated remains unclear and need to be further studied.

The endometrial stromal cell is one of the in-vitro models of the endometrial tissue used for the study of the molecular mechanisms of endometrial diseases. Decidualization is a process of endometrial stromal cell proliferation and subsequent differentiation, during which stromal cells transform into specialized decidual cells [36, 37]. This process is essential for embryo implantation and successful pregnancy. Although many studies have focused on the molecular mechanisms of decidualization, known lncRNAs associated with decidualization were limited. HK2P1 is a lncRNA found to be decreased in the decidua of severe preeclampsia patients. In vitro results show that downregulated HK2P1 inhibited human endometrial stromal cell (HESC) proliferation and differentiation by regulating miR-6887-3p and its target gene HK2 expression as a ceRNA [38]. The expression of another lncRNA, LINC00473, is highly induced in HESCs after decidual stimulus [39]. These studies prove a crucial role of lncRNA in stromal cell decidualization and suggest that lncRNAs participate in some endometrial diseases partly through affecting stromal cells, of which some may be caused by PCOS.

In the present study, CD36–005 was upregulated in the uteri of PCOS rat model and could promote the proliferation of stromal cells. However, the molecular mechanisms remain to be characterized. Thus, we conducted RNA-seq and found 55 known mRNAs in the primary endometrial stromal cells differentially expressed between the Ad-CD36–005 and Ad-GFP group with a threshold of p < 0.05 and |log2(Fold-Change)| > 1. We chose six mRNAs (Hmgn5, Nr5a2, Dll4, Entpd1, Fam50a, and Brms1) for qRT-PCR validation, and the results were consistent with the RNA-seq data. In previous studies, Qiao performed microarray analysis on the endometrial biopsies of women with PCOS during the implantation window and found down-regulated genes were associated with endometrial receptivity [40]. Similarly, Bellver performed microarray hybridization and identified an aberrant endometrial transcriptome in obese women with PCOS during the implantation window [41]. Among our RNA-seq result, several genes have been reported to be involved in endometrial disorders, but little is known whether these endometrial disorders are related to PCOS. Hmgn5, also known as Nsbp1, regulates uterine decidualization as a downstream gene of Hoxa10 in a differentiation-specific manner [42]. Hmgn5 was also found to be hypomethylated in mouse uteri when exposed to diethylstilbestrol or fenistein neonatally [43]. Nr5a2, also known as Lrh-1, was known as a key transcriptional factor of multiple steroidogenic genes in vitro [44]. In Wang’s study, Nr5a2 promotes aromatase expression in primary rat granulosa cells, indicating its potential involvement in PCOS while the ovaries of women with PCOS have abnormal steroidogenesis and folliculogenesis [45, 46]. Consistent with above report, Kevin elucidated in his review that a higher level of Lrh-1 could activate estradiol production in the endometrium of women with endometrial cancer [47]. Lrh-1 is also essential for a successful pregnancy as its indispensible roles in the luteal function, decidualization, and placental formation [48]. Combined with our result, we could speculate that the dysregulated expression of Nr5a2 may be associated with PCOS-associated endometrial disorders. Dll4, a gene involved in the delta-notch pathways, participates in the decidualization failure of stromal cells from women with endometriosis [49]. The promiscuous expression of Dll4 impaired decidual angiogenesis, and coordinated with disrupted decidual cellular proliferation and apoptosis, could be one of the causes of early miscarriages [50]. No relevant studies focus on the relationship of Entpd1, Fam50a, and Brms1 to endometrial disorders, and further studies are needed.

GO and KEGG analyses were performed to identify the potential functions and pathways of the 55 target genes of CD36–005. GO analyses revealed that these differentially expressed genes were involved in various categories, such as nitric oxide biosynthetic process and positive regulation of gene expression including toll-like receptor 7/9 (TLR-7/9) and interleukin-6/8 (IL-6/8). The nitric oxide (NO)/ nitric oxide synthase (NOS) system was presumed to locally regulate the endometrial functions, including stromal cells decidualization [51]. Nos2, a synthase involved in NO production, was upregulated by CD36–005 overexpression and predicted to be involved in the nitric oxide mediated signal transduction, nitric-oxide synthase activity, and nitric-oxide synthase binding. Nos2 was also found to participate in the inflammatory process of PCOS and some endometrial abnormalities [52, 53]. Thus, we can speculate that Nos2 may play a role in the pathogenesis of endometrial abnormalities of PCOS, however, there is no direct evidence and further studies are needed. TLR-7/9 and IL-6/8 were shown to be related to endometrial disorders. The expression of TLR-9 was increased with reduced DNA methylation in spontaneous preterm labor [54]. Higher TLR-9 transcriptional activity may be a protective factor for endometrial cancer risk [55]. According to Gu, the expression of TLR9 in cumulus cells was influenced significantly by PCOS, which may further lower the embryo quality and decrease the fertility rate of women with PCOS. These results suggest us the dysregulated expression of TLR9 may be potentially involved in the pathogenesis of PCOS and its adverse endometrial outcomes. TRL-7 is crucial in the establishment and maintenance of pregnancy in sheep [56]. IL-8 participates in the pathogenesis of endometriosis by regulating ectopic endometrial cell proliferation, invasion, and adhesion [57]. Levels of IL-6 in the mid-secretory-phase endometrium are lower in women with previous recurrent miscarriage [58]. Additionally, the aberrant IL-6 and IL-8 in endometrial stromal fibroblasts from women with PCOS was thought be related to the altered endometrial immune profile and imbalanced leukocyte migration, both of which contribute to a sub-optimal implantation of women with PCOS [59]. Thus, the regulation of these biological processes may be one of the complex mechanisms of some endometrial abnormalities, of which some might be induced by PCOS.

KEGG analyses showed that these differentially expressed genes were associated with diverse signaling pathways, including cell growth and death, transport and catabolism, signal transduction, lipid metabolism, endocrine and metabolic diseases, and cancers. Among these pathways, lipid metabolism was a biological process closely related to PCOS and its endometrial abnormalities. In previous studies, 70% of women with PCOS were found to have dyslipidemia, which is also a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and endometrial cancer [60]. Patients with PCOS commonly suffer from increased body mass index, total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, and decreased high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol [61]. In Chekir’s study, patients with PCOS have an increased uterine arterial pulsatility index and reduced endometrial thickness during the luteal phase, which may cause reproductive failure. The endometrial dysfunction induced by impaired uterine perfusion was thought to be correlated with dyslipidemia [61]. Nieman regarded endometrial cancer as the most relevant cancer with obesity. Adipocytes secrete adipokines and mediate the transition of androgens to estrogen, which promotes the development of endometrial cancer [62]. Mogat1 is a gene upregulated by CD36–005 overexpression and predicted to be involved in lipid metabolism. Hence, the differential upregulation of Mogat1 may participate in the pathogenesis of PCOS and its endometrial abnormalities through lipid metabolism. Above all, these results suggest a potential mechanism through which the dysregulated mRNAs involved in different categories and biological pathways contribute together to the regulation of stromal cells and the pathogenesis of endometrial abnormalities, some of which may be caused by PCOS.
We identified a list of 55 potential target mRNAs of CD36–005 in the primary endometrial stromal cells by RNA-seq and confirmed the relative expression levels of Hmgn5, Nr5a2, Dll4, Entpd1, Fam50a, and Brms1 using qRT-PCR. We used GO and KEGG pathway analyses, and predicted the various biochemical pathways that regulate the proliferation and decidualization of stromal cells and the pathogenesis of some endometrial abnormalities, in which these differentially expressed mRNAs may be involved in. Our results partly explained the mechanisms by which CD36–005 regulate the etiology and pathophysiology of PCOS in the uterus of rat with letrozole-induced PCOS, and laid a foundation for further studies on the molecular function and mechanism of CD36–005 in stromal cells. Further detailed studies are needed to clarify the underlying mechanisms of CD36–005 on the regulation of stromal cells and to investigate if these alterations could serve as biomarkers for the prediction of some endometrial diseases induced by PCOS.

B cell-depleting therapies have recently proven to be clinically highly successful in the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). This study aimed to determine the effects of the novel type II anti-human CD20 (huCD20) monoclonal antibody (mAb) obinutuzumab (OBZ) on spinal cord degeneration in a B cell-dependent mouse model of MS. Double transgenic huCD20xHIGR3 (CD20dbtg) mice, which express human CD20, were immunised with the myelin fusion protein MP4 to induce experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Both light and electron microscopy were used to assess myelination and axonal pathology in mice treated with OBZ during chronic EAE. Furthermore, the effects of the already established murine anti-CD20 antibody 18B12 were assessed in C57BL/6 wild-type (wt) mice. In both models (18B12/wt and OBZ/CD20dbtg) anti-CD20 treatment significantly diminished the extent of spinal cord pathology. While 18B12 treatment mainly reduced the extent of axonal pathology, a significant decrease in demyelination and increase in remyelination were additionally observed in OBZ-treated mice. Hence, the data suggest that OBZ could have neuroprotective effects on the CNS, setting the drug apart from the currently available type I anti-CD20 antibodies.

Multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) [1], manifests in dysfunction and apoptosis of oligodendrocytes and results in neurodegeneration [2]. It has a multifactorial etiology, with theories including genetics, viral causes, diet and vitamin D deficiency [3,4,5]. MS is the most common non-traumatic cause for neurological disability in young adults [6] with a worldwide prevalence of 2.3 million [7]. It has long been considered to be a predominantly T cell-mediated disease [8]. However, following the clinical success story of anti-CD20 antibody treatment in MS, B cells are attracting increasing attention regarding their role in the immunopathology of the illness [9]. Currently available and clinically developing antibodies, e.g., rituximab, ocrelizumab, ofatumumab and ublituximab are type I monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). While they are efficient at peripheral B cell depletion, primarily through induction of complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) [10,11], they do not significantly deplete B cells within the CNS even when applied intrathecally. This is attributed to the rapid efflux of the drug from the CNS into peripheral blood [12].

The type II anti-CD20 mAb obinutuzumab (OBZ) is currently under investigation for the treatment of MS and is already approved for the treatment of follicular lymphoma and chronic lymphatic leukaemia [13,14].

Compared to type I, type II anti-CD20 mAbs are thought to deplete tissue-resident B cells more efficiently, using an Fc-effector independent direct B cell death inducing mechanism [10].

The aim of this study was to determine the effects of anti-CD20 antibody treatment on late-stage CNS histopathology in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) [15], which is the most commonly used animal model of MS. In order to mirror the B cell component of MS pathology, we employed MP4-induced EAE, which relies on active disease induction with a fusion protein that consists of human myelin basic protein (MBP) and the three hydrophilic domains of proteolipid protein (PLP) [16,17]. We have previously demonstrated that MP4-induced EAE is both B cell- and antibody-dependent [18,19]. In this study two different models were used: Wild-type (wt) C57BL/6 (B6) mice were treated with the murine anti-mouse CD20 antibody 18B12 and huCD20xHIGR3 (CD20dbtg) mice received the humanised anti-CD20 antibody OBZ. CD20dbtg mice were created by cross-breeding the following two transgenic mouse strains: HuCD20tg mice that express both murine and human CD20 [20] and HIGR3 mice that express soluble human IgG since birth [21], resulting in their tolerance to it. Hence, the advantage of CD20dbtg mice is not only that they can be used to test therapeutic huCD20 mAbs such as the humanised OBZ, but also that they can be treated over a prolonged period of time since they will not generate a neutralising antibody response against the human drug.

Summarising our key findings, this study demonstrates a significant amelioration of spinal cord pathology using anti-CD20 treatment in both the wt and CD20dbtg model with slightly differential effects regarding axonal damage as well as de- and remyelination.
2.1. Anti-CD20 Treatment Did Not Affect Clinical EAE Severity When Administred during the Chronic Stage of the Disease
In the wt cohort, n = 13 B6 mice were immunised with MP4, of which n = 7 were treated with 18B12 and n = 6 with muIgG2a starting on day 30 after the peak of EAE. In the CD20dbtg cohort 1, n = 12 CD20dbtg mice were immunised with MP4, of which n = 6 were treated with OBZ and n = 6 with huIgG1 starting on day 30 after the peak of EAE. In the CD20dbtg cohort 2, n = 12 CD20dbtg mice were immunised with MP4, of which n = 6 were treated with OBZ and n = 7 with huIgG1 starting on day 50 after the peak of EAE. Depletion efficacy of anti-CD20 treatment was verified in all cohorts using flow cytometry of blood samples on the day of sacrifice (Table 1).

Cohort	Treatment	% of Depleted B Cells
Compared to Isotype Control	p Value
wt	18B12	99.81% ± 0.08%	p < 0.001

CD20dbtg2	OBZ	98.16% ± 0.33%	p < 0.001
As expected, MP4 induced chronic EAE in all mice. Clinical disease course and parameters for each cohort are shown in Figure 1 and Table 2. None of the cohorts showed a significant difference regarding the day of EAE onset, maximum EAE score, mean disease severity after onset and score at beginning of the treatment period when comparing the anti-CD20 and the isotype control antibody-treated groups. In addition, there was no significant difference in the EAE score before and after treatment in any of the three cohorts.

2.2. 18B12 Treatment Significantly Reduced the Extent of Axonal Damage in Chronic MP4-Immunised Wt Mice
Wt mice were sacrificed seven days after final treatment with 18B12. In order to assess CNS pathology, the lesion area was measured in semi-thin sections of the spinal cord (Figure 2A) and ultrastructural analysis was performed by electron microscopy (Figure 2B).

Values are displayed as mean values ± standard error of the mean (SEM). *: p < 0.05; **: p < 0.01. Statistical significance was determined using the Mann–Whitney U test.

As shown in Figure 2C, treatment with 18B12 significantly reduced the spinal cord lesion area in the ventrolateral tract (VLT) from 6.72% ± 1.84% to 0.49% ± 0.15%, which corresponds to a 92.8% decline compared to isotype control (p = 0.041). Similarly, ultrastructural analysis showed a reduction in the extent of axolysis from 25.43% ± 2.43% to 12.66% ± 2.75% in mice treated with 18B12, corresponding to a 50.2% decline compared to the isotype control group (p = 0.008). There was no significant effect on de- and remyelination.

2.3. OBZ Treatment Significantly Decreased Demyelination and Axonal Damage in Chronic MP4-Immunised CD20dbtg Mice
CD20dbtg mice were sacrificed seven days after final treatment with OBZ. In order to assess CNS pathology, the lesion area was defined in semi-thin sections of the spinal cord (Figure 3A) and ultrastructural analysis was performed by electron microscopy (Figure 3B).

Figure 3C demonstrates that treatment with OBZ starting on day 30 after the peak of EAE significantly reduced the spinal cord lesion area in the ventrolateral tract (VLT) from 9.14% ± 1.49% to 0.67% ± 0.22%, which corresponds to a 92.7% reduction compared to the isotype control (p = 0.004). Similarly, ultrastructural analysis showed a reduction of demyelination from 23.19% ± 4.52% to 11.82% ± 1.34%, corresponding to a 49.0% decrease (p = 0.022). There was also a significant reduction in the extent of axolysis (40.94% ± 6.33% in the isotype control group vs. 9.91% ± 2.24% in mice treated with OBZ, i.e., a reduction by 75.8% (p = 0.002)). No significant effect on remyelination was observed.

2.4. OBZ Treatment Significantly Increased Remyelination in Chronic MP4-Immunised CD20dbtg Mice
CD20dbtg mice were sacrificed seven days after final treatment with OBZ and spinal cord pathology was assessed as described in Section 2.3.

Ultrastructurally, treatment with OBZ starting on day 50 after the peak of EAE had no significant effect on lesion area or axolysis. However, there was a significant reduction in the extent of demyelination from 12.11% ± 1.99% to 0.17% ± 0.17%, which corresponds to a 98.6% decrease compared to isotype control (p = 0.002). Remyelination was increased from 0.57% ± 0.57% to 5.00% ± 1.46%—an increase of 779.8% (p = 0.009; Figure 4).

2.5. Serum NfL Levels Were Significantly Increased in EAE But Not Affected by Anti-CD20 Treatment in the Chronic Stage of the Disease
In order to broaden our point of view on neurodegeneration in the context of this study, we extended our analysis beyond electron microscopy, measuring serum levels of the neurofilament light (NfL) protein using ultrasensitive single molecule array (Simoa™) technology.

Neurofilaments (NFs) are intermediate filaments that are abundantly present in axons and responsible for their structural integrity. The NfL protein is currently being evaluated as a biomarker for neurodegeneration and disease progression in MS [22,23]. In Figure 5, the dashed line indicates the mean serum NfL level in non-immunised wt (n = 4) or CD20dbtg (n = 3) mice, respectively. Immunisation with MP4 triggered a significant increase in serum NfL levels (p = 0.01, Mann–Whitney U test, pooled values from all three cohorts). However, there was no significant difference between mice that received anti-CD20 antibody treatment and those treated with the corresponding isotype control antibody.

We correlated the degree of axolysis measured by electron microscopy, with serum NfL levels in individual mice. Figure 6 shows a fair correlation between these two parameters in all cohorts [24].

In the past decades, research has mainly focused on the role of T cells in the pathogenesis of MS [8]. In search of new therapeutic options, this viewpoint has broadened and progressively shifted towards the contribution of B cells. While the role of pathogenic antibodies and their specificity in MS is subject to ongoing debate [25], there is accumulating evidence that B cells are primary antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that drive autoreactive T cells and enhance compartmentalised CNS responses [26]. Additionally, it has been shown that B cells are able to secrete both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines [27] and are involved in the development of ectopic follicles in the CNS. The latter were mainly found in patients with secondary progressive MS (SPMS), resulting in more severe disease progression including an earlier onset, more pronounced demyelination, microglial activation, axonal loss and increase in irreversible disability [28]. Further interest in the role of B cells has been fuelled by successful therapeutic targeting of the CD20 molecule [29].

Anti-CD20 antibodies are grouped into type I and type II mAbs, the only antibody approved for the treatment of MS being the type I mAb ocrelizumab [30]. Another type I anti-CD20 mAb, rituximab, failed to significantly deplete CNS-compartmentalised B cells regardless of whether it was applied systemically or intrathecally [12], subsequently leaving potential for improved therapeutic approaches.

OBZ is a novel humanised type II mAb that was developed for blood B cell malignancies and autoimmune diseases [31]. It is already approved for the treatment of follicular lymphoma [14] and chronic lymphatic leukaemia [13].

While OBZ neither relocalises CD20 into lipid rafts nor induces CDC as strongly as type I mAbs, it does exhibit increased induction of direct and immune effector cell-mediated cytotoxicity [32]. This results in OBZ exhibiting superior and more potent B cell depleting activity compared to rituximab in both mice and cynomolgus monkeys [10,33]. Another difference between type I and II anti-CD20 mAbs resulting in differing biological characteristics pertains to their epitope binding, that while being adjacent and partially overlapping, causes the antibodies to orientate differently upon binding [34]. Strikingly, OBZ reaches these superior effects despite displaying only half of the maximal binding to CD20 [35].

18B12 is a widely used agent for anti-CD20 targeted B cell depletion in mice: Barr et al. used it to ablate IL-6-producing B cells, which improved disease progression in EAE [36]. Yu at al. depleted B cells using 18B12 in a murine model of spontaneous autoimmune thyroiditis in young mice to show that the following activation of regulatory T cells inhibited development of the disease in adult mice [37]. Casili et al. showed that 18B12 treatment lessened inflammation and tissue damage in a model of spinal cord injury [38].

Here we used the B cell-dependent MP4-induced EAE model to study the effects of anti-CD20 treatment on chronic spinal cord pathology. We employed both 18B12 in wt B6 mice as well as OBZ in CD20dbtg mice. Our data demonstrate that both antibodies (18B12 and OBZ) were highly efficient at reducing axonal damage, while OBZ additionally reduced demyelination and induced late-stage remyelination. Apart from electron microscopic assessment, we also measured serum NfL levels in both EAE models using the highly sensitive Quanterix Simoa™ array [39]. NfL analysis is currently being evaluated as a biomarker in MS patients [22]. Traces of NfL become detectable in the peripheral blood after being shed into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) upon CNS tissue damage. Increased levels are suggested to indicate disease progression because they correlate with expanded disability status scale (EDSS) worsening and clinical relapses in some studies [40]. They were also reported to predict 10-year MRI brain lesion load (brain T2 hyperintense lesion volume) and atrophy (brain parenchymal fraction) in MS patients and were lowered accordingly under disease modifying treatment [23]. While NfL levels were elevated in MP4- versus non-immunised mice, we found only a fair correlation with axolysis in a pooled analysis of all three cohorts, and there was no significant impact of an anti-CD20 antibody treatment on NfL levels. It is conceivable that this lack of effect can be attributed to the late time point of measurement in our study. In EAE, axolysis occurs early on [41], is irreversible and reaches its maximum during acute disease before declining in chronic EAE, which is then characterised by axonal loss. Hence, to determine the optimal effects of anti-CD20 antibody application on NfL levels, treatment and NfL readout earlier in the disease course, during acute EAE, would be advisable. Along these lines, we also did not observe a beneficial effect of diminished spinal cord pathology on clinical disease outcome following anti-CD20 antibody treatment. Unless a treatment is applied that repairs damaged axons, no improvement in EAE score can be expected during the chronic stage of the disease.

The results of our study seem promising regarding a potentially beneficial impact of OBZ on CNS pathology. When interpreting these results, it is important to bear in mind that EAE mirrors only some aspects of MS and cannot equate to the disease in its entirety. EAE requires the application of pertussis toxin to facilitate blood–brain barrier permeabilisation and of myelin antigens to induce autoimmunity, whereas MS in humans develops through a multifactorial etiology [4]. While drugs often show promising results in animal models, they are not always effective in the treatment of MS, even worsening the disease or causing severe side effects [42]. Now, further work is needed to directly compare the therapeutic effects of OBZ with other anti-CD20 antibodies in the CD20dbtg mouse model and to explore the possible placement of OBZ within the MS treatment landscape.
Male B6 mice were purchased from Charles River (Sulzfeld, Germany) and male CD20dbtg mice were obtained from Taconic Biosciences (Silkeborg, Denmark). This transgenic mouse strain had been engineered to express both murine and human CD20, and to tolerate human IgG1 molecules (see above for details). All mice were eight to nine weeks old at the time of immunisation and kept under specific pathogen-free conditions at the animal facility (“Präklinisches Experimentelles Tierzentrum” (PETZ)) of the University Erlangen-Nürnberg. Humidity and temperature were maintained at 45–65% and 20–24 °C and the facility kept under a twelve-hour light–dark cycle. The mice had free access to a standard autoclaved rodent diet (Ssniff Spezialdiäten, Soest, Germany) and autoclaved tap water. Sufficient feeding and drinking for paralysed mice were ensured by supplying food and water in a gel form at ground level. Stocking density of the cages was determined according to EU guideline 2010-63.

All animal experiments were performed according to protocols that were approved by the “Regierung von Unterfranken” (ethical approval code: RUF-55.5.5-2532-2-577) and complied with the German Law on the Protection of Animals, the “Principles of Laboratory Animal Care” (NIH publication no. 86-23, revised 1985) and the “ARRIVE guidelines for reporting animal research” [43].
In preparation for EAE induction, complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) was obtained by combining nine parts of paraffin oil (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and one part of mannide monooleate (Sigma-Aldrich) with 5 mg/mL Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37 Ra (BD Difco Laboratories, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). All mice were subcutaneously immunised in both sides of the flank with a total of 200 µg MP4 (Alexion Pharmaceuticals, New Haven, CT, USA) emulsified in 200 µL CFA. On the day of immunisation and 24 h later, the mice received 100 ng pertussis toxin (Hooke Laboratories, Lawrence, MA, USA) in 100 µL sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) intraperitoneally. Mice were scored daily to assess the progress of clinical symptoms according to the standard EAE scale: (0) no symptoms, (1) floppy tail, (2) hind limb weakness, (3) full hind limb paralysis, (4) quadriplegia and (5) death. Increments of 0.5 were used to account for intermediate scores not sufficiently determined by the five hallmarks.
Mice were divided into three cohorts:

“wt cohort” (wt);

“CD20dbtg cohort 1” (CD20dbtg1);

“CD20dbtg cohort 2” (CD20dbtg2).

The “wt cohort” consisted of n = 13 wildtype C57BL/6 mice, of which n = 6 were treated with a murine IgG-control antibody (muIgG2a; Bio X Cell, Lebanon, NH, USA) and n = 7 were treated with the murine anti-CD20 antibody 18B12 (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), both at a concentration of 5 mg/kg body weight in 50 µL PBS, into the lateral tail vein. Treatment was initiated at 30 days after the peak of EAE and repeated on day 33 and 36.

“CD20dbtg cohort 1” consisted of n = 12 transgene huCD20xHIGR3 mice, of which n = 6 were treated with a human IgG-control antibody (huIgG1; Roche) and n = 6 were treated with OBZ (Roche), both at a concentration of 5 mg/kg body weight in 50 µL PBS, into the lateral tail vein. Treatment time and frequency were equivalent to the wild-type cohort, initiated at 30 days after the peak of EAE and repeated on day 33 and 36.

“CD20dbtg cohort 2” consisted of the same strain and number of mice and received an equivalent treatment as “CD20dbtg cohort 1” but starting on day 50 after the peak of EAE and repeated on day 53, 56 and 59.
All mice were sacrificed with CO2 seven days after the final treatment. For Simoa™ NfL analysis, blood was collected from the inferior vena cava, centrifuged at 1000× g for 10 min and the serum stored at −80 °C until analysis. Mice were perfusion-fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA; Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) in PBS. The lumbar spinal cord was dissected and post-fixed at 4 °C overnight using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) fixing solution under slight agitation. The TEM fixing solution was prepared by dissolving 4 g 4% PFA and 2.14 g 0.1 M sodium cacodylate (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) in 50 mL double-distilled water (ddH2O). After cooling and filtration, 16 mL 25% glutaraldehyde (Roth) and 17 mL 1.2% picric acid (AppliChem, Darmstadt, Germany) were added and the solution was filled with ddH2O to reach 100 mL. The pH was titrated with either hydrochloric acid (Roth) or sodium hydroxide (Roth) to reach a pH of 7.2—7.4. The samples were then washed with PBS for 24 h, changing the buffer three times.
In preparation for light and electron microscopic analysis, spinal cord samples were treated with 1.5% potassium ferricyanide (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and 1% osmium tetroxide (Emsdiasum, Hatfield, PA, USA) in PBS for two hours at room temperature. In order to dehydrate and embed the samples, they were treated with 70% ethanol (Roth) for 60 min, then 80% ethanol, 90% ethanol, 100% ethanol, 100% ethanol (undenatured), 100% ethanol/acetone (Roth) 1/1, 2/3 acetone and 1/3 Epon, 1/3 acetone and 2/3 Epon for 45 min each and finally Epon and 2% glycidether accelerator DMP-30 (Roth) for 180 min. Epon was prepared by mixing two solutions (A and B) prior to use: Solution A consisted of 75 mL of glycidether 100 (Roth) and 120 mL of glycidether hardener DBA (Roth) and solution B consisted of 120 mL of glycidether 100 (Roth) and 105 mL of glycidether hardener MNA (Roth).

After dehydration, the samples were aligned in molds and coated with Epon and 2% glycidether accelerator DMP-30 and polymerised at 60 °C overnight.

For light microscopic analysis, the embedded tissue was transversely sliced at a thickness of 500 nm with an ultramicrotome (Leica Ultracut UCT, Wetzlar, Germany). Sections were covered in poly-l-lysine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and transferred to a microscope slide to be dried at 80 °C on a heating plate before being colored at 70 °C with a Richardson’s methylene blue solution for 2–3 min. Richardson’s methylene blue was prepared by mixing two solutions (C and D) prior to use: Solution C consisted of 1% azur II (Merck) dissolved in 1% borax water (sodium tetraborate × 10H2O (Roth) in ddH2O) and solution D consisted of 1% methylene blue (Merck) in 1% borax water. After being rinsed with ddH2O and being left on the heating plate to dry, the sections were submerged in xylol (Roth) and then covered in DePex (Serva). Light microscopic images were taken on a Leica DM2000 microscope (Leica Microsystems, Heerbrugg, Switzerland) with a Leica MC190 HD camera (Leica Microsystems) and acquired using the Leica Application Suite X (LAS X) software (Leica Microsystems).

For electron microscopy, the Epon blocks were subsequently cut at a thickness of 80 nm, stretched with chloroform (Roth) and transferred to copper grids (Emsdiasum) before being contrasted with 10% uranyl acetate (Emsdiasum) for ten minutes, rinsed with ddH2O and then treated for another ten minutes with 2.8% lead(II)citrate × 3H2O (Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA, USA). Electron micrographs were taken on a ZEISS EM 906 (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) using a cathode voltage of 60 kV, a magnification of ×6000 and acquired using the iTEM Software (Olympus Soft Imaging Solutions, Münster, Germany).

Images were analysed using the Image J software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). Ten images per mouse were analysed, covering the same areas of the spinal cord in the respective treatment groups being compared, namely the area adjacent to the anterior fissure of the ventrolateral tract (VLT). All axons contained within these ten images were counted in order to detect the percentage of axolytic axons. This resulted in an average number of n = 218.86 ± 9.79 (mean value ± SEM) axons analysed per mouse. In order to calculate the g-ratio, we then randomly selected five of the ten images and measured 20 axons per image, thus a total of 100 axons per mouse were included into the g-ratio analysis. This is according to the standard procedure as also described in [44].

The experimenter was blinded to the identity of the treatments during analysis of the samples. Lesion area was defined by analysing a methylene blue stained cross section of the lumbar spinal cord, measuring the lesion area and dividing it by the area of the entire VLT.

In order to describe myelin pathology, axons were grouped into one of three categories: normal, demyelinating or remyelinating. This classification is based on the g-ratio, a concept that relates the diameter of an axon to the diameter of the axon including its myelin sheath by dividing the former with the latter [45]. Our analysis was focused on axons in the ongoing process of demyelination, which are initially characterised by a swollen disintegrating myelin sheath and hence a decreased g-ratio. When an axon remyelinates, the myelin sheath wraps around the axon slowly and successively, hence the g-ratio increases compared to a normally myelinated axon, as defined in [46]. In order to generate a quantitative statement, it is necessary to relate the single measured g-ratio values to a reference group of healthy animals. We used naïve/non-immunised mice of both the CD20dbtg (n = 3) and wt (n = 4) strains described above, which resulted in the following ranges for normal myelination: 0.65–0.78 for the CD20dbtg and 0.58–0.85 for the wt cohort. These values were obtained by the addition and subtraction of three standard deviations to the mean obtained from the reference mice. Additionally, axonal pathology was assessed by determining the percentage of axolytic axons. Exemplary demyelinating, remyelinating and axolytic axons are shown in Figure 7.
One day before perfusion, blood was drawn from the tail vein and collected in Eppendorf tubes that contained 80 μL of heparin. Cells were stained with 1 µL of BD Horizon™ Fixable Viability Stain 450 (FVS450; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) and 1 µL of APC anti-CD19 antibody (BioLegend, London, UK) at room temperature for 30 min. Erythrocytes were lysed with 3 mL 1× RBC lysis buffer (BioLegend) for 10 min followed by centrifugation at 500× g for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded and cells resuspended in 3 mL of FacsFlow (BD Biosciences). Cells were once again centrifuged and resuspended in 150 µL of FacsFlow. Flow cytometric acquisition was performed on a CytoFLEX S equipped with CytExpert 2.2. software (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). Data analysis was performed using FlowJo version 10.0.6 (Tree Star Inc., Ashland, OR, USA). Dead cells were excluded from the analysis. Afterwards, doublets were excluded using the combined width parameter of the forward and side scatter.
Serum NfL levels were measured using ultrasensitive Single molecule array (Simoa™) technology, using the NF-light Advantage kit on an HD-X Analyzer according to instructions from the kit manufacturer (Quanterix, Billerica, MA, USA). The measurements were performed by board-certified laboratory technicians in one round of experiments using one batch of reagents. For a QC sample with a concentration of 7.4 pg/mL, the intra-assay coefficient of variation was 5.0%. For a QC sample with a concentration of 58.1 pg/mL, the intra-assay coefficient of variation was 4.0%.
The Mann–Whitney U test was used to determine statistical significance and computed using GraphPad Prism 8 (San Diego, CA, USA). Statistical significance was set at p ≤ 0.05 and is visualised by the following symbols: *: p < 0.05; **: p < 0.01 throughout the manuscript. All graphs are displayed with mean values and standard errors of the mean (SEM).

To investigate the involvement of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) Cancer Susceptibility 11 (CASC11) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).
This case–control study enrolled patients with CAD and age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. The plasma levels of lncRNA CASC11 and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1) were measured. Diagnostic values of lncRNA CASC11 and TGF-β1 for CAD were determined using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Correlations between plasma levels of lncRNA CASC11 and TGF-β1 were analysed using linear regression.
The study enrolled 82 patients with CAD and 82 healthy controls. Plasma levels of lncRNA CASC11 were downregulated in patients with CAD, while plasma TGF-β1 levels were upregulated in patients with CAD, compared with healthy controls. Plasma levels of lncRNA CASC11 and TGF-β1 distinguished patients with CAD from healthy controls and were inversely correlated in both groups. LncRNA CASC11 over-expression mediated the downregulation of TGF-β1 in human primary coronary artery endothelial cells, while TGF-β1 over-expression showed no significant effects on lncRNA CASC11 levels. An 8-year follow-up study showed that low lncRNA CASC11 levels were closely correlated with a higher mortality rate in patients with CAD.
LncRNA CASC11 is downregulated in CAD and inhibits TGF-β1.

Keywords: Coronary artery disease, lncRNA CASC11, transforming growth factor-β1, mortality
Coronary artery disease (CAD), also known as ischaemic heart disease, is caused by damaged major blood vessels, which are responsible for the supplying oxygen, blood and nutrients to the heart.1 Despite efforts made regarding the treatment and prevention of CAD, this disease remains one of the most common causes of death all over the world including China.2 As a result, more than 40% of deaths in China are caused by CAD.3 In addition, the incidence of CAD is increasing as a consequence of the development of modern society and changes in people’s lifestyles.4 Several risk factors, such as smoking, diabetes mellitus, dietary intake, obesity and dyslipidaemia, have been identified for CAD.5 However, the pathogenesis of this disease remains unclear, leading to difficulties in the development of novel therapeutic approaches.

Genetic alterations were frequently observed in patients with CAD, indicating the critical roles of genetic factors in this disease.6,7 Research has demonstrated that long (>200 nucleotides) non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) without any protein-coding ability can participate in physiological processes and disease progression by regulating the expression of genes.8,9 Expression of certain lncRNAs is altered during CAD, while functional investigations on lncRNAs in CAD are rare.10 LncRNA Cancer Susceptibility 11 (CASC11) plays a pivotal role in many types of cancer, such as gastric cancer,11 suggesting that it might also be of interest in CAD. A preliminary whole-genome transcriptome analysis undertaken by this current research team demonstrated the downregulation of lncRNA CASC11 in CAD (data not shown), so this present study investigated its potential involvement in patients with CAD.
This case–control study recruited consecutive patients with CAD from the Outpatient Department of the Health and Medical Centre of the People’s Hospital of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Urumqi City, Xinjiang Province, China between December 2009 and December 2011. A group of patients were selected from a larger group to participate in the study on the basis of the inclusion and exclusion criteria. All patients were confirmed to have CAD using coronary angiography. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (i) newly diagnosed; (ii) no therapies had been initiated. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (i) CAD patients transferred from other hospitals; (ii) any therapies for any clinical disorders were administered within 3 months prior to admission; (iii) any other obvious clinical disorders were observed. During the same time period, the current study enrolled healthy age- and sex-matched volunteers from the local population. All healthy participants from Urumqi City received systemic physiological examinations and the values of their physiological indicators were all within the normal range. All of the patients and healthy participants were informed of the experimental details and they provided written informed consent. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Health and Medical Centre of the People’s Hospital of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
Plasma samples
Before the initiation of any therapies, whole peripheral blood (5 ml) was collected from each patient with CAD and each healthy volunteer after an overnight fast. Whole peripheral blood was collected in tubes containing 1.5 mg/ml ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid. Following centrifugation using an Allegra X-30 centrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) at room temperature for 15 min at 1200 g, plasma was separated and stored in liquid nitrogen at –80°C before undertaking the following experiments.

Biochemical analyses
Biochemical data were retrieved from the medical records of the study participants.

Follow-up
Patients with CAD were followed up for 8 years after their initial diagnosis. Their survival conditions were monitored and recorded. This study did not include patients that were lost to follow-up or those that died of other causes.

Cells and transient transfections
LncRNA CASC11 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 expressing pcDNA3 vectors were constructed by Sangon (Shanghai, China). Human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs; ATCC, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) were transfected with pcDNA3 vectors expressing lncRNA CASC11 and TGF-β1, or empty pcDNA3 vector (negative control [NC]) using Lipofectamine® 2000 (Invitrogen, Shanghai, China). Cells were harvested at 24 h after transfection to perform the following experiments. Cells without any treatments were used as control (C) cells.

ELISA
The levels TGF-β1 in the plasma from patients with CAD and the healthy controls were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (ab100647; Abcam, Cambridge, UK). Levels of TGF-β1 in plasma were measured in ng/ml. The minimum detectable concentration was 80 pg/ml. Intra- and interassay coefficients of variation for all ELISAs were <5% and <10%, respectively.

Quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (qRT–PCR)
TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen) was used to extract total RNA from plasma (0.2 ml plasma per 1 ml TRIzol®) and HCAECs (105 cells per 1 ml TRIzol®). All RNA samples of satisfactory quality were subjected to DNase I digestion (Invitrogen). Following that, reverse transcriptase AMV (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) and SensiFAST™ SYBR® No-ROX One-Step Kit (Bioline, Boston, MA, USA) were used to carry out reverse transcriptions and prepare quantitative PCR mixtures, respectively. All experiments were repeated three times. Using 18S rRNA and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as internal housekeeping controls, the levels of lncRNA CASC11 and TGF-β1 RNA were analysed. The primer sequences were as follows: 5′-GCTGCAGAAGGTCCGAAGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTCACCACGTCCAGTTGCT-3′ (reverse) for CASC11; 5′-AAGAAGTCACCCGCGTGCT-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGTGTGATGTCTTTGGTTTTGT-3′ (reverse) for 18S rRNA; 5′-GGAGCGAGATCCCTCCAAAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGCTGTTGTCATACTTCTCATG-3′ (reverse) for TGF-β1; and 5′-CTACCACATCCAAGGAAGCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTTTTCGTCACTACCTCCCC-3′ for human GAPDH. The cycling programme involved preliminary denaturation at 95°C for 1 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 10 s and 58°C for 50 s. All PCR reactions were performed on a CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The relative amounts of lncRNA CASC11 and TGF-β1 mRNA to 18S rRNA and GAPDH were calculated using the 2–ΔΔCT method.

Western blot analysis
Total protein from HCAECs (105 cells per 1 ml RIPA buffer) was extracted using RIPA buffer (Sangon). After denaturing, the proteins were separated using sodium dodecyl sulphate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% gel). Following protein transfer to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Invitrogen) and blocking (2 h in 5% non-fat milk at room temperature), the membranes were incubated with rabbit anti-GAPDH primary polyclonal antibodies (1:800; ab9485; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and rabbit anti-TGF-β1 primary polyclonal antibodies (1:800; ab92486; Abcam) overnight at 4°C. After washing the membranes in Tris-buffered saline Tween 20 (TBST; pH 7.4) three times (15 min per wash), the membranes were incubated with goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin-horseradish peroxidase secondary antibodies (1:800; MBS435036; MyBioSource, Cambridge, UK) for 2 h at room temperature. Immunodetection was undertaken using an enhanced chemiluminescence method (Sigma-Aldrich). Image J version 1.46 software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MA, USA) was used to analyse and normalize the signals.

Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS® statistical package, version 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows®. Data are presented as mean ± SD, which were calculated from three replicates. Differences between patient and control groups were determined using the unpaired t-test. Differences among different cell transfection groups were analysed using one-way analysis of variance and Tukey test. The diagnostic analysis was performed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Correlations were analysed by performing linear regression. The patients with CAD were stratified in to high and low lncRNA CASC11 level groups. Based on follow-up data, the Kaplan–Meier method was used to plot survival curves. A log-rank test was performed to compare the survival curves. A P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
The case–control study identified 228 patients with CAD and selected 82 (49 males and 33 females; mean ± SD age, 48.5 ± 9.1 years; age range, 33–63 years). A total of 82 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers were also enrolled in the study (49 males and 33 females; mean ± SD age, 47.9 ± 8.6 years; age range, 33–64 years). The clinical and demographic characteristics of the patients and healthy controls are presented in Table 1. All 82 patients completed 8-year follow-up. The patients with CAD were stratified into high (n = 39) and low (n = 43) lncRNA CASC11 level groups.

The diagnostic values of lncRNA CASC11 and TGF-β1 for CAD were determined by performing a ROC curve analysis. In this analysis, patients with CAD were the true positives and the healthy controls were the true negatives. For plasma lncRNA CASC11, the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.90 (AUC > 0.65 identified diagnostic potential) (Figure 2a). For plasma TGF-β1, the AUC was 0.87 (Figure 2b).

The diagnostic potential of plasma levels of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) Cancer Susceptibility 11 (CASC11) (a) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 (b) for coronary artery disease (CAD) was determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses. Plasma levels of lncRNA CASC11 and TGF-β1 distinguished CAD patients from healthy controls by ROC curve analysis.

Correlations between plasma levels of lncRNA CASC11 and TGF-β1 were analysed by performing linear regression. Plasma levels of lncRNA CASC11 and TGF-β1 were inversely and significantly correlated in both the CAD group (Figure 3a) and control group (Figure 3b). The relationship between lncRNA CASC11 and TGF-β1 was further analysed by performing over-expression experiments in HCAECs. Compared with the control (C, untransfected cells) and the negative control (NC, empty vector transfection) groups, the levels of lncRNA CASC11 and TGF-β1 mRNA were significantly increased in HCAECs transfected with lncRNA CASC11 and TGF-β1 expression vectors at 24 h after transfection (Figure 3c; P < 0.05 for all comparisons). Moreover, HCAECs with lncRNA CASC11 over-expression showed significantly downregulated TGF-β1 at both the mRNA and protein levels (Figure 3d; P < 0.05 for all comparisons). However, TGF-β1 over-expression showed no significant effects on lncRNA CASC11 mRNA levels (Figure 3e).

Studies of the effect of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) Cancer Susceptibility 11 (CASC11) on transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1. Linear regression analyses demonstrated that plasma levels of lncRNA CASC11 and TGF-β1 were inversely and significantly correlated in both the CAD group (a) and the control group (b). The levels of lncRNA CASC11 and TGF-β1 mRNA were significantly increased in human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) transfected with lncRNA CASC11 and TGF-β1 expression vectors compared with the control (C) and negative control (NC) groups (c). The over-expression of lncRNA CASC11 mRNA mediated the downregulation of TGF-β1 mRNA and protein in HCAECs compared with the C and NC groups (d); The over-expression of TGF-β1 mRNA showed no significant effects on lncRNA CASC11 mRNA levels (e). Data are presented as mean ± SD. Differences among different cell transfection groups were analysed using one-way analysis of variance and Tukey test; *P < 0.05.

The cut-off value for CASC11 that was used to stratify patients into high and low lncRNA CASC11 level groups was 2.12. The prognostic value of lncRNA CASC11 for CAD was determined by performing a Kaplan–Meier survival curve analysis based on lncRNA CASC11 levels. During the 8-year follow-up, CAD patients in the low lncRNA CASC11 level group (n = 43) showed a significantly lower overall survival rate compared with patients in high lncRNA CASC11 level group (n = 39) (P < 0.05) (Figure 4).

The prognostic value of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) Cancer Susceptibility 11 (CASC11) for coronary artery disease (CAD) was determined by performing a Kaplan–Meier survival curve analysis based on lncRNA CASC11 levels. During the 8-year follow-up, CAD patients in the low CASC11 level group (n = 43) showed a significantly lower overall survival rate compared with patients in high CASC11 level group (n = 39) (P < 0.05).
This current study investigated the expression pattern, clinical values and function of lncRNA CASC11 in patients with CAD. This current study demonstrated that lncRNA CASC11 levels were downregulated in patients with CAD and that changes in plasma lncRNA CASC11 levels may be of potential prognostic and diagnostic value as a biomarker for CAD. In addition, lncRNA CASC11 also downregulated TGF-β1 levels, which is involved in CAD.12,13

Coronary artery disease causes an unacceptably high mortality rate and accurate diagnosis and prognosis are extremely important.3With the advantage of their noninvasive nature, circulating biomarkers, such as blood lncRNAs, have shown promising potential in disease diagnosis.14 A novel lncRNA named CoroMarker has been identified as a promising biomarker for CAD.10 CoroMarker is upregulated in CAD and is independent of other CAD biomarkers.15 Another study showed that the polymorphisms of lncRNA MALAT1 could be used to predict CAD in a Chinese population.16 A preliminary whole-genome transcriptome analysis undertaken by this current research team demonstrated the downregulation of lncRNA CASC11 in CAD (data not shown). This present study further confirmed the downregulation of lncRNA CASC11 in patients with CAD. In addition, altered levels of plasma lncRNA CASC11 distinguished patients with CAD from healthy control subjects. Therefore, lncRNA CASC11 may be used to assist the diagnosis of CAD in clinical practice, while its sensitivity and specificity remain to be further investigated.

To the best of our knowledge, there are limited studies on the prognostic value of lncRNAs for CAD. This current 8-year follow-up study investigated the association between the levels of lncRNA CASC11 and the mortality rate of patients with CAD. These current data suggest that low levels of lncRNA CASC11 before treatment were closely correlated with poor survival of patients with CAD. Therefore, measuring the levels of lncRNA CASC11 before treatment may guide the development of individualized treatment strategies, thereby improving the survival of patients with CAD.

Transforming growth factor-β signalling controls cardiovascular function,17 such as maintenance of heart homeostasis.18 Upregulated levels of TGF-βs, such as TGF-β1, is closely correlated with the development of CAD.12,13 Over-expression of TGF-β1 promotes the development of CAD by regulating downstream genes, such as sphingosine kinase 1 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 to regulate heart cell behaviour, such as apoptosis.12,13 Similarly, this current study observed increased plasma levels of TGF-β1 in patients with CAD compared with healthy control subjects. This current study also demonstrated that lncRNA CASC11 over-expression downregulated TGF-β1 mRNA and protein levels. Therefore, lncRNA CASC11 may also be used as a therapeutic target for CAD.

This current study was limited by the small sample size. In addition, the mechanism that mediates the interaction between lncRNA CASC11 and TGF-β1 remains unclear. Future studies are needed to address these issues.

In conclusion, the levels of lncRNA CASC11 were downregulated in patients with CAD and had diagnostic and prognostic value. The over-expression of lncRNA CASC11 can downregulate TGF-β1. Therefore, regulation of lncRNA CASC11 may also prove beneficial for the treatment of this disease in the future.

The methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway found in many bacteria governs the synthesis of isoprenoids, which are crucial lipid precursors for vital cell components such as ubiquinone. Because mammals synthesize isoprenoids via an alternate pathway, the bacterial MEP pathway is an attractive target for novel antibiotic development, necessitated by emerging antibiotic resistance as well as biodefense concerns. The first committed step in the MEP pathway is the reduction and isomerization of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate (DXP) to methylerythritol phosphate (MEP), catalyzed by MEP synthase. To facilitate drug development, we cloned, expressed, purified, and characterized MEP synthase from Yersinia pestis. Enzyme assays indicate apparent kinetic constants of KM DXP = 252 µM and KM NADPH = 13 µM, IC50 values for fosmidomycin and FR900098 of 710 nM and 231 nM respectively, and Ki values for fosmidomycin and FR900098 of 251 nM and 101 nM respectively. To ascertain if the Y. pestis MEP synthase was amenable to a high-throughput screening campaign, the Z-factor was determined (0.9) then the purified enzyme was screened against a pilot scale library containing rationally designed fosmidomycin analogs and natural product extracts. Several hit molecules were obtained, most notably a natural product allosteric affector of MEP synthase and a rationally designed bisubstrate derivative of FR900098 (able to associate with both the NADPH and DXP binding sites in MEP synthase). It is particularly noteworthy that allosteric regulation of MEP synthase has not been described previously. Thus, our discovery implicates an alternative site (and new chemical space) for rational drug development.
Referred to as “The Great Mortality” by contemporaries, Black Death irrevocably changed the social and economic structure of 14th century Europe, killing one-third of the Western European population [1]. Black Death, an outbreak of the plague, was caused by the Gram negative bacterium Yersinia pestis [1], [2]. In light of its high morbidity/mortality rate, ease of dissemination, associated emergency response procedures, and significant social impact, Y. pestis is now categorized by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as a Category A biological threat agent (i.e. an agent of greatest concern). Our vulnerability to outbreaks of infectious disease is further underscored by the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic, the 2003 SARS outbreak, the 2001 anthrax letter attacks, and the 1984 Rajneeshee Salmonella attacks, stressing the necessity of effective vaccines and antimicrobial/antiviral therapeutics. The ease by which antibiotic resistance can be deliberately engineered into bacteria, and the increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistant strains, also emphasizes the need for continued development of novel antibiotics against new bacterial targets.

Isoprenoids are a crucial family of molecules that includes compounds such as quinones and cholesterol and are involved in a number of cellular processes, from electron transport to signal transduction to the regulation of membrane fluidity. Each member of this diverse family of molecules is derived from two common building blocks; isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and its isomer dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP), synthesized via the mevalonic acid (MVA) or methyl erythritol phosphate (MEP) pathways (Figure 1). Because the MEP pathway is exclusively utilized by many human pathogens, and knockout of MEP pathway genes has proven lethal in bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis [3], Francisella tularensis [4], Escherichia coli [5], and Vibrio cholerae [6], the MEP pathway enzymes have received considerable attention as promising targets for the development of novel antibiotics (reviewed in [7] [8] [9]).

The MVA and MEP biosynthetic pathways.
A) The MVA pathway is utilized by humans and other eukaryotes, archaebacteria, and certain eubacteria to produce IPP and DMAPP, the building blocks of isoprenoids. The pathway is initiated by the enzymatic condensation of 3 molecules of acetyl-CoA (1) to form 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) (3), which is then reduced to MVA by HMG-CoA reductase (4) [54] [55] Subsequent phosphorylation and decarboxylation yield IPP (7) [56] [57] [58] which is converted to DMAPP (8) by an isomerase [59]. B) The MEP pathway is used by higher plants, the plastids of algae, apicomplexan protozoa, and many eubacteria, including numerous human pathogens. Pyruvate (9) is condensed with glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (10) to yield 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP; (11)) [60], a branch point intermediate with a role in E. coli vitamin B1 and B6 biosynthesis [61] [62] [63] [64] as well as isoprene biosynthesis. In the first committed step of the E. coli MEP pathway, 1-Deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (also called MEP synthase, Dxr or IspC) catalyzes the reduction and rearrangement of 11 to yield MEP (12) [28]. CDP-ME synthase then converts MEP into 4-(cytidine 5′-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol (CDP-ME; (13)). CDP-ME kinase phosphorylates CDP-ME, which is subsequently cyclized (coupled with the loss of CMP) by cMEPP synthase to yield 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate (15) [65] [66] [67] [68] [69]. A reductive ring opening of 15 produces 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-butenyl diphosphate (HMBPP; (16)) [70] [71] [72] [73] [74], which is then reduced to both IPP and DMAPP in a ∼5:1 ratio [8] [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] [80]. C) The reaction catalyzed by MEP synthase. The intermediate 2-C-methyl-D-erythrose 4-phosphate (18), produced by isomerization via cleavage of the bond between C3 and C4 and formation of a new bond between C2 and C4 [81] [82], is subsequently reduced to yield MEP (12).

The drug discovery process typically involves five distinguishable phases; target identification, target validation, lead molecule identification, lead optimization, and preclinical and clinical trials. The identification of lead molecules often involves the screening of a molecular library. In general, molecular libraries typically contain synthetic compounds, either rational or random in design, and/or natural products extracted from a wide variety of plant, bacteria, or fungal sources. While natural products underwent a period of reduced attention (a consequence of several factors including the substantial effort required to isolate the active component from a complex mixture, the effort required to elucidate the chemical structure of the active component, significant advances in protein structure determination by crystallography and NMR, improvements to in silico rational drug design using the protein structure, and the combinatorial chemistry approach to rapidly populating synthetic chemical libraries), natural product libraries are coming back in vogue, as the number of new chemical entities entering into clinical trials continues to decline. Nearly one-third of the pharmaceuticals worldwide are natural products or their derivatives. In fact, most antibacterial drugs originate from natural products, including the β-lactams, tetracyclines, aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol, cephalosporins, macrolides, lincosamides, rifamycins, streptogramins, the glycopeptides, and the lipopeptides. The blockbuster anticholesterol drug Mevacor (lovastatin), a natural product produced by the fungus Aspergillus terreus, inhibits HMG-CoA reductase, thereby blocking the rate limiting enzyme in the MVA isoprene biosynthetic pathway (Fig. 1) [10] [11].

Several groups have demonstrated an interest in developing small molecule inhibitors of the MEP pathway enzymes, including those that target DXP synthase [12], [13], MEP synthase (reviewed in [14]), CDP-ME synthase [15], [16], CDP-ME kinase [17], [18], cMEPP synthase [19], [20], HMB-PP synthase [21], [22], and HMB-PP reductase [23], [24]. While each of these MEP pathway enzymes is a viable target for drug development [25] the focus of this report is on MEP synthase. Herein we describe the cloning, expression, and kinetic characterization of purified Y. pestis MEP synthase, the first committed enzyme of the MEP isoprene biosynthetic pathway. Using known MEP synthase inhibitors, we demonstrate the effectiveness of inhibiting both the purified enzyme and liquid cultures of Y. pestis. We also report the outcome of an in-house high-throughput screen of both a rationally designed synthetic compound library and a natural product library, resulting in the identification of several inhibitor hits, including a completely novel class of MEP synthase inhibitors that functions via an allosteric mechanism.
The following reagent was obtained through the NIH Biodefense and Emerging Infections Research Resources Repository, NIAID, NIH: Yersinia pestis subsp. A1122, cultured at 37°C in Tryptic Soy Broth with 0.1% cysteine (TSB). Recombinant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL cells from Stratagene, La Jolla, CA that were grown at 37°C in Luria-Bertani (LB) media supplemented with 100 µg/mL ampicillin and 50 µg/ml chloramphenicol. All liquid cultures were constantly shaken at 250 rpm. Agar (1.5% wt/vol) was added to prepare solid media.
The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) for FR900098, a known MEP synthase inhibitor [7], was determined via a dose-response plot of cell growth (OD600) as a function of inhibitor concentration. An overnight culture of Y. pestis subsp. A1122 was grown in TSB and harvested by centrifugation (15 min, 2450×g, 25°C). The resulting cell pellet was washed twice with 1 mL of TSB then diluted to an OD600 of 0.2. Aliquots of the culture were then dispensed into 10×1 cm foam-capped test tubes containing 2 mL of fresh TSB and FR900098 added to the tubes at the indicated concentrations. Bacterial growth was monitored over 24 hrs. Each condition was evaluated in duplicate. Nonlinear regression fitting the resulting dose-response plot was achieved using GraphPad Prism version 4.00 for Windows (GraphPad software Inc, San Diego, CA) and the equation F = 1/(1+[I]/IC50) where F = fractional growth and [I] = inhibitor concentration. For growth inhibition assays run with rationally designed compounds, a small volume protocol was used in which a diluted overnight culture was used to inoculate 400 µL of TSB containing the appropriate concentration of inhibitor. Cultures were grown in foam-capped, 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and monitored over 24 hours. For the small volume protocol, each condition was evaluated in triplicate.
The Y. pestis CO92 MEP synthase gene (ispC) was identified in the complete genome sequence using primary sequence homology with orthologs from other organisms. Sequence alignment was accomplished using Clustal Omega, with the following reference sequence numbers and protein sequence numbers obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI): Y. pestis (NC_003143.1, YP_002346091.1), E. coli (U00096.2, AAC73284.1), M. tuberculosis (NC_000962.3, NP_217386.2), F. tularensis (AJ749949.2, CAG46207.1), V. cholerae (NC_002505.1, NP_231885.1), B. anthracis (AE016879.1, AAP27179.1), M. leprae (NC_002677.1, NP_302094.1), and T. pallidum (NC_000919.1, NP_219039.1) The Y. pestis ispC gene was synthesized (GenScript USA Inc, Piscataway, NJ) and cloned into a pET101/D-TOPO vector, facilitating the expression of a C-terminal His-tagged protein. Restriction mapping and DNA sequencing were used to confirm the construction of the plasmid (pYpIspC). The plasmid was transformed into chemically competent E. coli BL21 CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for protein expression.

A 10 mL overnight seed culture of E. coli BL21 CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL+pYpIspC was added to 1 L of LB media and incubated with shaking at 37°C and 250 rpm. Once an OD600 of 1.8 was achieved, protein expression was induced using 0.5 mM isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and the culture was allowed to incubate for an additional 18 hours. Cells were harvested via centrifugation (4650×g, 20 min) and stored at −80°C. Protein was isolated and purified from the cells via chemical lysis and affinity chromatography. Cell lysis was achieved using Lysis Buffer A (100 mM Tris pH 8, 0.032% lysozyme, 3 mL per mg cell pellet), followed by Lysis Buffer B (0.1 M CaCl2, 0.1 M MgCl2, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.020% DNase, 0.3 mL per mg cell pellet). Centrifugation (48,000×g, 20 min) yielded the clarified cell lysate that was passed through a TALON immobilized metal affinity column (Clontech Laboratories, Mountain View, CA). The column was washed with 20 column volumes of 1× equilibrium buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl), 10 column volumes of 1× wash buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole), and 15 column volumes of 2× wash buffer (100 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 600 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole). The protein was then eluted with 5 column volumes of 1× elution buffer (150 mM imidazole pH 7.0, 300 mM NaCl). Buffer was exchanged with 0.1 M Tris pH 7.5, 1 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT during concentration by ultrafiltration. Protein concentration was determined using Advanced Protein Assay Reagent (Cytoskeleton, Denver CO) with γ-globulins (Sigma-Aldrich) as the standard. Purified protein was visualized via Coomassie stained SDS-PAGE. The yield of YpIspC averaged 30 mg per 1 L shake flask. M. tuberculosis and F. tularensis MEP synthase [26] were cloned, expressed, and purified essentially as described above.
MEP synthase activity was assayed at 37°C by spectrophotometrically monitoring the enzyme catalyzed oxidation of NADPH (Fig. 1C), as previously described [27]. All assays were performed in duplicate. To determine the apparent KM for 1 deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP), 120 µL assay solutions contained 100 mM Tris pH 7.8, 25 mM MgCl2, 150 µM NADPH, 0.89 µM MEP synthase, and variable concentrations of DXP (Echelon Biosciences, Salt Lake City, UT). The assay solution was incubated at 37°C for 10 minutes to allow NADPH to associate with the enzyme prior to the addition of DXP. To determine the apparent KM for NADPH, assays were performed with fixed DXP concentration (0.4 mM) and a variable concentration of NADPH. Nonlinear regression to the Michaelis-Menton equation enabled the determination of kinetic constants. To determine cation specificity, assays were performed with 25 mM MgCl2, CaCl2, CoCl2, CuCl2, MnCl2, or NiCl2. Assays performed with isopentenyl pyrophosphate, dimethylallyl pyrophosphate, and geranyl pyrophosphate (Echelon Biosciences, Salt Lake City, Utah) included a 10 minute preincubation with the enzyme (37°C) before addition of NADPH. The half-maximal inhibition (IC50) by fosmidomycin and FR900098 were determined by using a plot of enzyme fractional activity as a function of inhibitor concentration. As they are slow, tight binding inhibitors [28], fosmidomycin and FR900098 were pre-incubated with the enzyme for 10 minutes prior to the addition of the substrate. Molecular library screening for inhibitors also included this pre-incubation step.
The Y. pestis MEP synthase was homology-modeled using I-TASSER (http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/I-TASSER/) [29] [30] [31]. Templates were selected by I-TASSER’s threading alignment algorithm which considers predicted secondary structure features in the sequence and identifies analogous and homologous protein templates. The optimized model was then evaluated with ProQ2 (http://www.bioinfo.ifm.liu.se/ProQ2/) [32], which uses features such as atom-atom contacts, residue-residue contacts, solvent accessibility, and secondary structure information to assign an accuracy score from 0 (unreliable) to 1 (reliable). Swiss- PdbViewer 4.0 (http://spdbv.vital-it.ch/) was used to visualize and annotate the model.
A rationally designed, small molecule library was compiled using compounds synthesized as described [33]. Each compound was designed from resolved crystal structures of M. tuberculosis MEP synthase in complex with fosmidomycin [33] [34] and contains an amide-linked or O-linked functional group.

A natural product library was compiled in house using extracts obtained from 80 different biological sources. After solvent extraction, the extracts were dried under vacuum, dispensed by mass, and resuspended in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for use in the screen. For dose-response and mechanism of inhibition plots, inhibitor concentrations are dilutions relative to the original stock solution.
Validating the Y. pestis MEP pathway as an antimicrobial target
The streptomycete natural products known as fosmidomycin [35] and FR900098 [36] belong to the phosphonate class of molecules and are well characterized inhibitors of MEP synthase, the enzyme responsible for catalyzing the first committed step in the MEP pathway (Fig. 1). Fosmidomycin is currently undergoing clinical trials due to its demonstrated inhibitory activity against a variety of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, as well as malaria parasites [37], [7]. The phosphonate inhibitors are actively transported into cells via a glycerol-3-phosphate transporter (GlpT, [38]), although lipophilic phosphonate prodrugs have proven highly effective MEP pathway inhibitors against pathogens lacking the GlpT protein (e.g. Mycobacterium tuberculosis [39] [40]). A BLAST search with the E. coli GlpT sequence (accession P08194) identifies a homologous transport protein in the Y. pestis CO92 proteome (YP_002347496; 18% identity/33% homology to the E. coli GlpT sequence). To evaluate the effectiveness of MEP pathway inhibition in Y. pestis, a growth inhibition assay was performed using FR900098. As depicted in Figure 2, FR900098 clearly inhibits Y. pestis proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, with half maximal inhibition (IC50) at 29 µM (6.4 µg/mL), comparable to the potency observed with ampicillin (Figure S1) and to the activity of fosmidomycin with F. tularensis (12.1 µM; [26]). Hence, MEP pathway inhibition appears to be a valid and effective means of inhibiting the propagation of Y. pestis. Thus, to facilitate the development of novel MEP synthase inhibitors, we next cloned and characterized the Y. pestis enzyme.

Fractional growth is calculated as the ratio of cell density (OD600) in the presence of inhibitor to cell density in the absence of inhibitor. Nonlinear regression fitting was performed, resulting in an IC50 of 29 µM (6.4 µg/mL). The goodness-of-fit (R2) value is indicated. For comparison, the IC50 of ampicillin is 10.8 µM (3.8 µg/mL; see Figure S1).

Characterization of the Y. pestis MEP synthase
The 1197 bp MEP synthase gene (ispC; Gene ID: 1173888) was identified in the fully virulent Y. pestis subsp. orientalis str. CO92 genome sequence (NC_003143.1) through its homology with other known ispC gene sequences. The predicted amino acid sequence of the CO92 MEP synthase is identical to those predicted from the genomes of the virulent KIM 10+ and avirulent A1122 Y. pestis strains (NC_004088.1 and NC_017168.1, respectively), encoding a projected 43.1 kDa protein. Figure S2 displays a primary sequence alignment of the Y. pestis MEP synthase with several bacterial homologs, highlighting the conservation among the family of enzymes. In particular, active site catalytic residues are strictly conserved across the enzymes, as is the serine residue identified previously as a potential site of phosphoregulation [26]. Figure S3 presents a predicted tertiary structure of the Y. pestis MEP synthase, homology-modeled using I-TASSER. Overall, the predicted topology of the enzyme active site is highly conserved with those seen in the structurally resolved MEP synthases [41], [42]. However, subtle but notable differences are observed. Most significantly, the positioning of histidine 209, an active site residue known to coordinate the phosphonate moiety of fosmidomycin in the M. tuberculosis MEP synthase [43], is more akin to that observed in the E. coli homolog, wherein this histidine does not specifically associate with the phosphonate [44]. While the predicted structural differences may simply be a consequence of computational modeling, the slight alterations in active site topology might account for differences observed among the derived kinetic constants and the relative potency of inhibitors with the various homologs of MEP synthase (as described below).

To enable the enzymatic characterization of the Y. pestis MEP synthase, the CO92 ispC gene was cloned into the pET101/D expression vector, transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) codon plus RIL cells, and the resulting recombinant protein was affinity purified to near homogeneity via a C-terminal histidine tag (Figure 3). The catalytic activity of the purified recombinant enzyme was determined by a spectrophotometric assay monitoring the substrate dependent oxidation of NADPH (Fig. 1C). Nonlinear regression fitting of enzyme velocity versus substrate concentration was used to determine the apparent kinetic constants (Figure 4 and Table 1). The KMapp for 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) was obtained using assays performed with a saturating concentration of NADPH (150 µM), whereas the KMapp for NADPH was determined using assays with 400 µM DXP. In general, the recombinant Y. pestis MEP synthase has KMapp,DXPand KMapp,NADPH values that are comparable to those reported for homologous enzymes from other organisms (Table 1). The apparent specificity constant (KcatDXP/KMDXP) is also similar to the Francisella, Mycobacterium, and Synechocystis enzymes, although it is nearly 50 fold lower than that reported for the E. coli enzyme, predominantly due to the difference in KcatDXP. An evaluation of various divalent cations reveals that recombinant Y. pestis MEP synthase can equally use Mg2+ or Mn2+ (Figure 5), in contrast to the F. tularensis enzyme, which demonstrates a clear preference for Mg2+ [26], and the E. coli enzyme which can utilize Mg2+, Mn2+, or Co2+ [45]. The M. tuberculosis enzyme, initially thought to be strictly dependent upon Mg2+ [46], was also shown to utilize Mn2+ ( [47], [43]).

We next determined the susceptibility of the Y. pestis MEP synthase to the phosphonate inhibitors fosmidomycin and FR900098. The resolved crystal structures of M. tuberculosis MEP synthase co-crystalized with either fosmidomycin [43] or FR900098 [34] reveal a slight steric clash among an active site tryptophan residue and the ketone methyl group of FR900098, which is reflected in the corresponding half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of fosmidomycin (80 nM) and FR900098 (160 nM) [48]. However, this phenomenon appears unique to the M. tuberculosis enzyme, as FR900098 is more potent than fosmidomycin when assayed with the MEP synthase from F. tularensis [26], P. falciparum [49], and Synechocytis sp. PCC6803 [50] and is comparable in potency to fosmidomycin with the MEP synthase from E. coli [49] and P. aeruginosa [51]. In agreement with this consensus, as depicted in Figure 6, while the efficacy (Emax) of the two inhibitors are nearly identical, FR900098 demonstrates greater potency with the Y. pestis MEP synthase than does fosmidomycin, with IC50 values of 231 nM and 710 nM, respectively. Furthermore, this preference is further apparent in comparison of the measured inhibition constants, with a Kifos of 968 nM and KiFR900098 of 170 nM (Table 1 and Figure S4). Hence, while there appear to be subtle nuances in the active site topology of the M. tuberculosis MEP synthase that confers specificity for fosmidomycin, the Y. pestis MEP synthase demonstrates a clear preference for FR900098, as is also observed with the other aforementioned orthologs.

Molecular Library Screening
We next sought to evaluate the amenability of the Y. pestis MEP synthase in a high throughput screening format. The quality and robustness of an enzyme assay are important considerations for the reliable screening of a molecular library, and are typically described in terms of the Z-factor [52]. Ideally, an assay should have a large dynamic range (the difference between the uninhibited and inhibited signals) and small standard deviation across replicates, which corresponds to a Z-factor score near a value of 1 (an assay with a Z-factor score between 0.5 and 1.0 is considered excellent for screening). To determine the Z-factor for the spectrophotometric assay using the Y. pestis MEP synthase, we fixed the DXP concentration to the KM, used a saturating concentration of NADPH (150 mM), and evaluated three separate lots of purified enzyme in a series of assays performed over three consecutive days. FR900098 was used as a positive control for inhibition. The Z-factor was determined to be 0.9, indicative of an assay well suited for library screening.

Rational Library Screening
To further assess the Y. pestis MEP synthase in a screening platform, we screened two pilot scale molecular libraries for inhibitory activity. The first library consists of 50 rationally designed synthetic compounds, primarily modeled on the structures of the M. tuberculosis MEP synthase in complex with fosmidomycin or FR900098 ( [43], [34]). As introduced elsewhere [33], the strategy for the synthesis of this library was to create novel compounds with either amide- or O-linked substituents appended to the retrohydroxamate moiety of fosmidomycin/FR900098, thereby targeting the two major binding sites in MEP synthase; the fosmidomycin/DXP site and the NADPH site, bridging these adjacent sites to yield a highly specific ligand. Select structures of the inhibitors are shown in Figure 7. As anticipated, when screening this rational library against the purified Y. pestis MEP synthase, several of the compounds were found to demonstrate significant inhibitory activity (>75% inhibition), as illustrated in Figure 8. The top five inhibitors were subsequently evaluated in dose-response assays (Figure 9), with compounds 15 and 16 demonstrating the greatest potency. Due to the potential for competitive bisubstrate inhibition, we also evaluated 15 and 16 by preincubating the enzyme with inhibitor prior to the addition of NADPH or DXP (in contrast to the assays depicted in Figure 9, wherein the enzyme was concomitantly exposed to NADPH and the inhibitor). As shown in Figure 10, the resulting IC50 values for compounds 15 and 16 improve approximately 3- and 12-fold, respectively, supportive of competitive inhibition relative to both NADPH and DXP. It is particularly noteworthy that the IC50 for compound 16 (0.3345 µM) approximates one half of the MEP synthase concentration used in the assay, indicative of a tight-binding inhibitor.

Assays were performed by combining the enzyme with either A) compound 15 or B) compound 16 and preincubating at 37°C for 10 min before addition of NADPH and DXP. All assays were performed in duplicate. Activity of the enzyme is relative to an uninhibited control.

To further explore if compound 16 inhibits by occupying both the DXP and NADPH binding sites, we next performed inhibitor modality assays with the purified Y. pestis MEP synthase. Catalysis by MEP synthase involves an ordered bi bi reaction mechanism, wherein NADPH must bind to the enzyme before DXP [45]. This mechanism is indicative of an underlying conformation change accompanying the binding of NADPH, thereby resulting in the formation of the DXP binding site. Accordingly, relative to DXP, fosmidomycin and FR900098 are competitive inhibitors of MEP synthase, while they are uncompetitive with respect to the binding of NADPH [45] [33] (Figure S5). Hence, NADPH must first bind to the enzyme before fosmidomycin/FR900098 can compete with DXP for its binding site.

In light of the fosmidomycin and FR900098 mechanism of inhibition, and given the anticipated mechanism for the bisubstrate inhibitor 16, we performed mode of inhibition assays in each of two ways; the first with 16 added after preincubating the enzyme with NADPH (Figure 11) and the second with compound 16 preincubated with the enzyme prior to the addition of any other substrates (Figure 12). As illustrated in Figures 11 and ​and12,12, compound 16 is competitive with respect to DXP and competitive with respect to NADPH, under either of the two assay conditions. Thus, in contrast to fosmidomycin and FR900098, compound 16 does not require the initial binding of NADPH to the enzyme. In fact, as it competes with NADPH for a binding site, its activity is more potent when preincubated with MEP synthase in the absence of NADPH (contrast the concentrations of 16 used in the plots shown in Figures 11 and ​and12).12). Due to its ability to bind to the NADPH site, compound 16 appears capable of promoting the same structural change in the enzyme as does NADPH, causing the ensuing formation of the DXP binding site. Consequently, compound 16 behaves as a tightly bound inhibitor, binding to the NADPH site and causing a conformation change that subsequently “locks” the inhibitor into the DXP site. Further exploration of this mechanism is currently underway.

Mode of inhibition with preincubation.
When the Y. pestis MEP synthase is preincubated with compound 16 (37°C, 10 min) prior to the addition of NADPH and DXP, the Lineweaver–Burk plots still indicate that compound 16 is competitive with respect to DXP (A) and NADPH (B). All assays were performed in duplicate.

Satisfied that the Y. pestis MEP synthase performed well in the pilot scale high throughput screen, we next sought to complete our evaluation of the rational library by determining if compounds 15 and 16 would make good lead molecules for subsequent drug development. Secondary to the enzyme assays, compounds 15 and 16 were next evaluated in a growth inhibition assay with liquid cultures of Y. pestis A1122. As shown in Figure 13, relative to FR900098, compounds 15 and 16 demonstrate measurable but modest inhibitory activity towards Y. pestis. Given the potent activity of these compounds towards the isolated enzyme, we speculated that the relatively poor activity towards whole cells might reflect cell permeability limitations. However, as seen in Fig. 13, inhibitory activity is not dramatically improved with lipophilic ester derivatives of compound 15 (compounds 51 and 52), suggesting that compound efflux and/or intracellular instability may impact the effective concentration of the inhibitor. While further investigation is required to deduce the specific details pertaining to the activity of compounds 15 and 16, our pilot scale screening of a rational library demonstrates the amenability of the Y. pestis MEP synthase to high throughput screening (and underscores the importance of the secondary screen in lead molecule selection).

Growth inhibition assay with liquid cultures of Y. pestis.
Y. pestis A1122 was cultured in the presence of either 100 µM or 500 µM of the indicated inhibitor. Bacterial growth is relative to an uninhibited culture. All assays were performed in triplicate. At 500 µM, compounds 15, 16, 51, and 52 have inhibitory activity comparable to FR900098, however relatively poor inhibitory activity is observed at 100 µM. See text for further discussion.

Natural Product Library Screening
In addition to screening a rationally designed molecular library, we also screened our proprietary natural product library for inhibitory activity against the purified Y. pestis MEP synthase. This library contains 80 different extracts obtained from widely diverse biological sources. Each individual extract consists of a complex mixture of metabolites (a metabolome) isolated via a non-targeted organic extraction. As shown in Figure 14, four of the 80 extracts demonstrate significant inhibitory activity (>75% inhibition). Subsequent dose-response assays confirm this inhibitory activity and identify extract 29 (e29) as the most potent inhibitor among the four (Figure 15). A follow-on Y. pestis growth inhibition assay demonstrates the dose-dependent activity of e29 (Figure 16).

Screening of a natural product library.
The Y. pestis MEP synthase was assayed in the presence of ca. 75 µg/mL of the indicated extract. Residual activity is relative to the assay performed with vehicle alone (DMSO). Assays with fosmidomycin and FR900098 were performed with 100 µM inhibitor. All assays were performed in duplicate. Of those compounds tested, four inhibit the enzymatic activity by >75%, including e5, e18, e29, and e74. The activity of e29 is comparable to that of fosmidomycin.

Figure 16
Yersinia pestis growth inhibition assay with extract 29.
Y. pestis A1122 was cultured in the presence of e29 at the indicated concentrations. Bacterial growth is relative to an uninhibited culture. All assays were performed in duplicate. The extract inhibits bacterial growth in a dose-dependent fashion.

In light of its inhibitory activity, we next determined the e29 mechanism of action using the purified Y. pestis MEP synthase (Figure 17). While FR900098 is uncompetitive with respect to NADPH and competitive with respect to DXP (Figure S5), the binding of e29 is uncompetitive with respect to NADPH but noncompetitive with respect to DXP. As this represents an entirely new class of MEP synthase inhibitor, we performed additional, confirmatory assays with purified recombinant F. tularensis and M. tuberculosis MEP synthase, the results of which corroborate this discovery (Figure S6). Hence, e29 contains an active compound that serves as an allosteric inhibitor of MEP synthase (Figure 17C). To date, no such inhibitors of MEP synthase have been reported, making the inhibitory compound in e29 a novel class of inhibitor, and suggesting a new binding site on MEP synthase amenable to rational drug design. As MEP synthase regulates metabolic flux through the MEP pathway [53], we speculated that isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP), and/or geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP) might serve as feedback inhibitors of the enzyme. Hence, we assayed the Y. pestis MEP synthase in the presence of each of these individual compounds at concentrations of 100, 500, and 1000 µM. No enzyme inhibition was observed under any of the assay conditions (data not shown). Thus, the active component of e29 is not likely to be any of these three isoprenoids. Effort is currently underway to isolate and identify the active component in e29.

Figure 17
Mechanism of inhibition by e29.
A) Relative to NADPH, e29 is an uncompetitive inhibitor of the purified Y. pestis MEP synthase. B) Relative to DXP, e29 is a noncompetitive inhibitor. C) A model of e29 inhibition. MEP synthase (E) undergoes a conformational change (E*) upon binding of NADPH (N), exposing an allosteric site to which the inhibitor (I) binds. As the inhibitor is noncompetitive with respect to DXP (D), I may bind the E*N or E*ND complex, thereby inhibiting the enzyme.
In response to the urgent need for novel antibiotics, MEP synthase has received considerable attention as a target for drug development. The Y. pestis MEP synthase demonstrates significant sequence conservation with its orthologous counterparts, therefore leading to a predicted tertiary structure that is comparable to crystallographic-defined structures of MEP synthase. However, structural comparison identifies subtle differences among the MEP synthase family, particularly within the active site of the M. tuberculosis homolog, thereby rationalizing the observed differences in measured inhibitor activity. These structural differences warrant further consideration when developing rationally designed broad spectrum antibiotics.

The screening of a rationally designed, synthetic, bisubstrate molecular library, developed from crystal structures of the M. tuberculosis MEP synthase, demonstrated the amenability of the Y. pestis MEP synthase to a screening campaign and identified several effective inhibitors of the purified enzyme. Subsequent mechanistic assays reveal that the most effective inhibitor (compound 16) binds to both the NADPH and DXP sites, acting as a potent tight binding inhibitor of the enzyme. However, a growth inhibition secondary screen reveals that the whole-cell inhibitory activity of compound 16 is relatively poor, indicating the need for additional structure−activity relationship studies to elucidate the underlying etiology.

By screening a library of natural product extracts, we identified four biological mélanges containing an inhibitor of MEP synthase. The most potent extract, e29, reduced MEP synthase enzymatic activity by roughly 90% and demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibition of Y. pestis growth in vitro. While all previously reported MEP synthase inhibitors bind in the active site of the enzyme, the active component in e29 is the founding member of a new class of desirable allosteric inhibitors of the enzyme. Unlike competitive inhibitors of an enzyme, which lose potency as the substrate pools accumulate, an allosteric inhibitor maintains effectiveness while metabolic flux through the pathway is impeded.

Fractional growth is calculated as the ratio of cell density (OD600) in the presence of inhibitor to cell density in the absence of inhibitor. Ampicillin is an FDA approved inhibitor of bacterial transpeptidase, resulting in the disruption of cell wall biosynthesis. Nonlinear regression fitting was performed, resulting in an IC50 of 10.8 µM (3.8 µg/mL). The goodness-of-fit (R2) value is indicated.

Graphical determination of the inhibition constant. Because fosmidomycin and FR900098 are slow, tight binding inhibitors, the Y. pestis MEP synthase was preincubated with the inhibitor for 10 minutes prior to addition of substrate. The absolute value of the X intercept of the line produced from linear regression fitting the plot of KM app,DXP as a function of inhibitor concentration defined the Ki as 968 nM and 170 nM for fosmidomycin and FR900098, respectively. The R2 values are indicated.

Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) slows the decline in kidney function in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), yet the mechanisms mediating this effect remain unclear. The Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) rat develops hypertension and progressive renal injury when fed a high salt diet; however, the effect of alkali loading on kidney injury has never been investigated in this model. We hypothesized that NaHCO3 protects from the development of renal injury in Dahl salt-sensitive rats via luminal alkalization which limits the formation of tubular casts, which are a prominent pathological feature in this model. To examine this hypothesis, we determined blood pressure and renal injury responses in Dahl SS rats drinking vehicle (0.1 M NaCl) or NaHCO3 (0.1 M) solutions as well as in Dahl SS rats lacking the voltage-gated proton channel (Hv1). We found that oral NaHCO3 reduced tubular NH4+ production, tubular cast formation, and interstitial fibrosis in rats fed a high salt diet for 2 weeks. This effect was independent of changes in blood pressure, glomerular injury, or proteinuria and did not associate with changes in renal inflammatory status. We found that null mutation of Hv1 also limited cast formation in Dahl SS rats independent of proteinuria or glomerular injury. As Hv1 is localized to the luminal membrane of TAL, our data suggest that alkalization of the luminal fluid within this segment limits cast formation in this model. Reduced cast formation, secondary to luminal alkalization within TAL segments may mediate some of the protective effects of alkali loading observed in CKD patients.
In response to evidence from a number of small clinical trials as well as experimental models which have provided evidence that correction of metabolic acidosis may slow the decline in kidney function [1–4], oral sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) therapy is now common in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Despite growing clinical use, there are relatively few published studies aimed at understanding the underlying physiological mechanisms mediating the beneficial actions of NaHCO3 treatment on the kidney.

Chronic kidney disease encompasses a diverse range of pathological processes that lead to prolonged reductions in renal function. The Dahl salt-sensitive rat model is a model of salt-sensitive hypertension and progressive renal injury. Importantly, the Dahl salt-sensitive rat model shares a number of pathological phenotypes observed commonly in the African-American population in which salt-sensitivity is prevalent and the risk of developing CKD is significantly greater than in whites [5], including insulin resistance and a low renin form of hypertension [6–10]. The Dahl salt-sensitive rat also develops marked and progressive renal disease following a high salt intake, which is characterized by glomerular sclerosis, medial-intimal vascular thickening, and the formation of numerous tubular proteinaceous casts [11]. As such, the Dahl salt-sensitive rat model provides a unique, naturally occurring, genetic model of progressive renal injury, which may be of particular relevance to the high-risk hypertensive black population.

Despite its wide use as a model of salt-sensitivity and progressive renal disease, the effect of alkali loading on kidney injury in the Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) rat has never been directly investigated. As the mechanisms through which alkali loading may mediate a protective effect on the kidney are still relatively poorly understood, and may differ between experimental models, in the current study, we investigated the effect of oral NaHCO3 loading on blood pressure and renal disease progression in the Dahl SS rat model. As tubular casts are a prominent pathological feature in this model, and precipitation of filtered proteins within the tubular lumen may be enhanced under acidic conditions [12], we hypothesized that NaHCO3 protects from the development of renal injury in Dahl salt-sensitive rats via luminal alkalization which limits tubular cast formation. To examine this hypothesis, we determined blood pressure and renal injury responses in Dahl SS rats following two interventions that would alkalinize the tubular lumen via alternative mechanisms. First, we compared blood pressure and renal injury in Dahl SS rats drinking vehicle (0.1 M NaCl) or NaHCO3 (0.1 M) solutions which would promote both systemic and urinary alkalization. Second, we compared these same parameters in wild-type and Hv1−/− mutant Dahl SS rats, which lack the voltage-gated proton channel (Hv1). As Hv1 promotes proton extrusion from cells and is localized to the luminal membrane of TAL, we predicted that loss of this channel would result in alkalization of the luminal fluid within the thick ascending limb segment and limit protein precipitation and subsequent cast formation in the absence of systemic alkalization. To exclude the possibility that changes in renal hemodynamics or inflammation were responsible for the protective effects of NaHCO3 loading, we measured renal arterial blood velocity, proteinuria, and the polarization (inflammatory/anti-inflammatory) of renal macrophages.
Animals
Studies used 8–10-week-old male Dahl SS rats obtained from Charles River laboratories (Wilmington MA; where noted) or, when comparing wild-type and Hv1−/− rats, from an in house colony at Augusta University (derived from the Dahl SS rat stain at the Medical College of Wisconsin). Rats were maintained ad libitum on water and a pellet diet containing low 0.4% NaCl (AIN76A; Dyets Inc; Bethlehem PA (LS)). All studies were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All of the protocols were approved in advance by the institutional animal care committee at Augusta University. Upon receipt from Charles River Inc., rats were allowed to acclimatize in our animal facility for 1 week prior to surgeries being performed. All rats were initially maintained on a low Na+ diet. All protocols were initiated at least 7 days after surgery to allow time for rats to recover.

Treatment protocol
The treatment protocol, experimental groups entering the protocol and the measurements performed on each group are outlined in Figure 8. To determine the effect of NaHCO3 on renal injury in the Dahl SS rat model, either NaHCO3 or equimolar NaCl was given to high salt fed rats via the drinking water. All rats were initially maintained on LS chow and ad libitum tap water. At the beginning of the experimental protocol, tap water was replaced with water containing either 0.1 M NaHCO3 (Sigma) or equimolar (NaCl 0.1 M) that was made fresh daily and administration maintained for the remainder of the protocol. Following 3 days of treatment, rats were placed in metabolic cages for a 24-h urine collection. The following day, rats were placed on an 8% high salt diet (AIN76A 8%; Dyets; HS) which was maintained for a further 2 weeks. Additional 24-h urine collections were obtained on day 7 and 14 of HS feeding. Following 14 days of HS feeding, rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (2–5%) and tissue harvested for histology and biochemical analysis.

Outline of experimental protocols
A–C list the comparisons between animal group experiments. Listed with each experimental group (1–4) are the experimental protocols performed on that group. All groups underwent the same treatment protocol outlined in the diagram. All rats were 8–10 weeks old upon entering the protocol and were initially maintained on low salt (LS) chow and tap water. Rats were then switched to either vehicle (0.1 M NaCl) or sodium bicarbonate (0.1 M NaHCO3) instead of tap water. On day 3 of low salt feeding (D3LS) and following 2 days of drinking treated water, a 24-h urine collection was performed (highlighted column; protocol 1 only). Rats were then switched to an 8% high salt (HS) diet for the remainder of the protocol. 24-h urine collections were obtained on day 7 of high salt (D7HS) and day 14 of high salt (D14HS) feeding. Following day 14 of high salt feeding rats were humanely killed and tissue harvested (red arrow); SS, salt-sensitive.

Blood pressure measurement
Rats were anesthetized (2–5% isoflurane) and blood pressure telemeters (Data Sciences International, St Paul, MN) surgically implanted according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Rats were allowed to recover for 1 week before beginning blood pressure recordings. During experimental protocols, blood pressure was recorded from the abdominal aorta 24 h daily in 10-min intervals and mean pressures over 24 h were reported.

Arterial blood gas measurements
Arterial blood gas and plasma electrolyte responses (including, pH, pCO2, pO2, HCO3−, Hct, Na, K, Cl, and glucose) were measured in a separate set of rats. Dahl SS rats obtained from Charles River Laboratories were anesthetized (2–5% isoflurane) and the left femoral artery was catheterized. Surgically implanted catheters were then tunneled under the skin and exposed between the shoulder blades. Catheters were protected by a light wire spring attached to a swivel (Instech Laboratories Inc, Plymouth Meeting, PA), which allows free 360-degree movement of the animal. Rats were individually housed and allowed to recover for 1 week before beginning experimental measurements. Catheters were filled with heparinized saline (30 U/ml) and connected to an infusion pump (Phd2000, Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA). Infusions of heparinized saline were maintained at 100 μl/h over the course of the protocol. Arterial blood samples (0.2 ml) were taken prior to placing rats on treated water, on day 3 of LS feeding and on day 7 of HS feeding by disconnecting the catheter from the infusion pump proximal to emergence of the catheter from the rat and drawing arterial blood into a heparinized 1 ml of syringe. Arterial blood gas measurements were performed on a Rapidpoint 4055 Blood gas analyzer (Seimens AG, Munich Germany) within 20 min of taking the sample. Arterial blood gas measurements on day 14 of HS feeding were taken at the time of killing by left ventricular puncture immediately after induction of anesthesia with isoflurane (2–5%).

Urinary analysis
Urine collection
For urine collection, rats were placed in metabolic cages for 24 h (Nalgene, Rochester, NY). Urine was collected and weighed for volume determination. Up to 10 ml of urine was stored at −80°C for later analysis. All urinary data are presented as 24-h urinary excretion.

NH4+ excretion
Urinary NH4+ concentration was determined using an ammonia ion selective electrode (Orion high performance ammonia ion selective electrode; Thermo Fischer Scientific Inc.). Urine samples were diluted in Orion ionplus Solution Alkaline Reagent immediately before measurement as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Measurements were compared with those of a standard curve using serial dilutions of the Thermo Scientific Orion Application Solution 0.1 M NH4+ Ammonium Standard. Final concentrations were calculated using a logarithmic curve (Graphpad Prism 6; Graphpad software Inc, La Jolla, CA).

Proteinuria
Urinary protein concentration was determined by standard Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA)

Measurement of renal arterial blood velocity
Ultrasound measurement of renal arterial blood velocity, an index of renal blood flow, was performed in a separate group of rats. Ultrasound was performed as described previously [13]. In brief, on the day of measurement rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (2–5%) and imaged in a supine position on a SA-11283 rat platform with integrated temperature sensor, heater, and ECG electrodes (VisualSonics, Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Rectal temperature was maintained at 37.5°C by a UV heating lamp. Depilatory cream (Nair, Ewing, NJ) was used to remove fur from the region of interest and medical ultrasound acoustic gel (Other-Sonic, Pharmaceutical Innovations, Newark, NJ) was used as a coupling fluid between the real-time microvisualization (RMV) scanhead and the skin. Ultrasound imaging was performed using the Vevo 770 system (VisualSonics, Toronto, ON, Canada). Using B-mode imaging, the RMV-716 scanhead was positioned and held immobile using the VisualSonics Vevo Integrated Rail System II to view the rat kidney. Renal artery blood velocity was measured using pulse-wave Doppler (PW-mode). Following a brief stabilization period, several measurements of pulse-wave Doppler blood velocity were obtained from the left renal artery and the mean velocity from all measurements recorded.

Histological analysis
Tissue harvest and fixation
At the end of the study, rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (2–5%), the left and right renal arteries ligated and both kidneys excised. Kidneys were decapsulated, bisected, and placed in 10% formalin solution (Sigma; St Louis, MO) for 48 h before being paraffin embedded, blocked, and processed (Augusta University Core facility).

Assessment of tubular casts
For assessment of tubular cast area, paraffin embedding sections were stained with Gomori’s Trichrome (Gomori’s Trichrome stain kit blue collagen, Richard-Allan Scientific, MI) as per the manufactures’ instructions. In brief, rat kidney sections (5 μm) were deparaffinized and hydrated with deionized water. Sections were then placed in Bouin’s Fluid at 56°C for 1 h. Sections were first stained in Weigert’s iron hematoxylin for 10 min, then stained in Trichrome for 15 min. Sections were then placed in 1% acetic acid solution for 1 min before being rinsed in deionized water, dehydrated, cleared, and mounted. Five nonoverlapping images were taken of each section at low power (5 magnification; (1 papilla region, 2 separate outer medulla regions, 2 separate cortex regions)) using an Olympus×BX40 microscope equipped with an Olympus DP72 camera and Olympus CellSens standard software (Olympus Inc, Japan). At this magnification, all of the medulla and most of the cortex were imaged. Images were then blinded to the investigator and sections were analyzed using MetaMorph offline software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) by color threshold for protein cast as data are expressed as % thresholded area of total tissue area.

Glomerular sclerosis
Gomori’s trichrome stained sections were blinded to the investigator and then scored by a renal pathologist as the % of glomeruli indicating sclerosis.

Fibrosis
Renal tissue fibrosis was determined using a Sirius Red/Fast Green Collagen Staining Kit (Chondrex Inc; Redmond, WA), according to the manufactures’ instructions. In brief, thick 15-μm sections were deparaffinized and hydrated with distilled water. Approximately 200 μl of dye solution was utilized to completely immerse the tissue sections. Sections were then incubated at room temperature in a moist chamber for 30 min. Sections were then rinsed with distilled water before adding 1 ml of dye extraction buffer to elute the dye from the tissue section. The eluate was collected into a 1.5 ml of disposable cuvette and read using a spectrophotometer (Genesys 10S UV-Vis spectrophotometer; Thermo Fischer Scientific Inc.) at OD 540 and 605 nm to determine collagen (an index of fibrosis) and non-collagenous proteins respectively. Data are expressed as collagen/non-collagenous proteins according with the manufacture’s instructions.

Effect of Hv1 on intracellular pH in isolated perfused thick ascending limb
As we suspected NaHCO3 was acting to limit cast formation in Dahl SS rats by alkalinizing the tubular lumen of the thick ascending limb, we investigated whether an alternative approach to promote luminal alkalization would have a similar effect. As Hv1 promotes proton efflux from cells and, within the kidney, Hv1 is localized to the luminal membrane of TAL, we hypothesized that loss of this channel would promote luminal alkalization and prevent cast formation. To confirm that Hv1 promotes H+ efflux in perfused TAL, we measured intracellular pH changes in isolated perfused TAL from wild-type and Hv1−/− Dahl SS rats in response to addition of extracellular NH4Cl. NH4Cl is normally present in the luminal fluid, and due to its rapid uptake in actively transporting TAL, promotes cellular acidification in this segment [14]. LS fed wild-type and Hv1−/− Dahl SS rats (Augusta University) were anesthetized with isoflurane (2–5%), the kidney perfused with chilled Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS) pH 7.4 (20 mM HEPES) and isolation of mTAL tissue strips performed as described previously [15]. Renal thick ascending limb were dissected from the inner stripe of the outer medulla, placed on a glass coverslip coated with the tissue adhesive Cell-Tak (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA). After loading with 2’,7’-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF: 6 μmol/l) in Hank’s balanced salt solution for 1 h at room temperature, coverslips were transferred to an imaging chamber mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope (IX81 Olympus) that was maintained at 37°C (Warner Instruments) and allowed the rapid exchange of superfusion buffer. Glass pipettes (Drummond Scientific, Broomail, PA) were pulled to an internal diameter of 8–14 μm. The tip of these micropipettes was beveled and smoothed and mounted on a micromanipulator (World Precision Instruments) on the microscope stage. As our laboratory [16] has previously described, a micropipette was inserted into the open lumen of the mTAL, and the tubule was perfused with HBSS (pH 7.40) at ~10 nl/min. The signal was detected using a high-resolution digital camera (Photometrics Evolve, Roper Scientific). Excitation was provided by a Sutter DG-4 175W xenon arc lamp (Sutter Instruments) that allowed high-speed excitation wavelength switching. Regions of interest containing mTAL epithelial cells were selected within each TAL to quantify changes in fluorescent intensity of the BCECF dye using Metafluor imaging software (Universal Imaging). A BCECF fluorescence lens kit was utilized to collect the fluorescent signal (Chroma Technology Corp., Bellows falls, VT). Following perfusion with HBSS to stimulate transport activity, florescent signals were recorded for 200 s before exchanging the bath solution (HEPES buffered HBSS, pH 7.40) with an identical solution containing 1 mM NH4Cl and fluorescent signals recorded for a further 500 s.

Assessment of effect of NaHCO3 on macrophage polarization in splenic tissue of wild-type and Hv1−/− Dahl SS rats
We recently reported that oral NaHCO3 loading promotes anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage polarization in the spleen, and that these macrophages then infiltrate the kidney [17]. As infiltration of anti-inflammatory immune cells may be renal protective, we examined the effect of NaHCO3 on splenic macrophage polarization in wild-type and Hv1−/− Dahl SS rats. In order to evaluate the effect of NaHCO3 on the inflammatory phenotype of macrophages in wild-type and Hv1−/− Dahl SS rats, we employed a flow cytometry-based strategy as previously described by our group [18–21]. Spleens were harvested from wild-type and Hv1−/− Dahl SS rats at the end of the HS protocol and placed in RPMI + 10% FBS. Spleens were then injected with three 1 ml injections of 100 CD units/ml Collagenase IV (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ, U.S.A.) and placed in 1 ml of 400 CD units/ml Collagenase IV, incubated at 37°C for 30 min and minced. Single-cell suspensions were achieved using a 100 μM cell strainer (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) followed by centrifugation (1500 rpm, 10 min) and erythrocytes lysed by incubation with ACK lysing buffer (3 min; catalog no. 10–548E; BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD, U.S.A.). Cells were then washed twice (10 mM EDTA in Ca/Mg-free PBS).

M1 (inflammatory) macrophages were identified as CD11b/F4/80/TNFα triple positive cells. M2 (regulatory/anti-inflammatory) macrophages were identified as CD11b/CD206/IL10 triple positive cells (Figure 6). Antibodies/reagents utilized are listed in Table 1. Cells were then incubated with antibodies for surface markers for 15 min at 4°C in the dark (all antibodies from Pharmingen-BD-Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Cells were then washed with PBS, fixed, and permeabilized using Cytofix-Cytoperm (eBiosciences, San Diego, CA) for 20 min in the dark at room temperature before incubation with antibodies for intracellular staining of TNFα and IL-10 on ice in the dark for 20 min (BD Biosciences). Cells were then washed and run through a four-color flow cytometer (FACS Calibur, Becton-Dickinson), and data were collected using CellQuest software.

Samples were double-stained with control IgG and cell markers and were used to assess any spillover signal of fluorochromes; proper compensation was set to ensure that the median fluorescence intensities of negative and positive cells were identical and were both gated populations. Gating was used to exclude dead cells and debris using forward and side scatterplots. In each analysis, 100,000 total events were collected. As a gating strategy, for each sample, isotype-matched controls were analyzed to set the appropriate gates. For each marker, samples were analyzed in duplicate measurements. To minimize false-positive events, the number of double-positive events detected with the isotype controls was subtracted from the number of double-positive cells stained with corresponding antibodies (not isotype control) respectively. Cells expressing a specific marker were reported as a percentage of the number of gated events.

Visualization of the spleen at midline/sham splenectomy: We have recently reported that breaking of fragile mesothelial connections to the spleen by splenic manipulation or total splenectomy, completely abolished the anti-inflammatory effect of NaHCO3 on macrophage polarization in the kidney [17]. Dahl salt-sensitive rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (2–5%) and a midline incision performed. The spleen was either (1) untouched; (2) located and gently moved toward the incision site by hand or with cotton tip applicators, the poles of the spleen visualized, and the spleen returned to its original position; (3) the splenic vessels ligated with silk ties and the spleen removed. The midline incision was then closed and rats allowed to recover. Following the surgical procedures, rats were allowed to recover for 7 days before entering the HS protocol described above.

End-point analysis
For histological scoring (casts, glomerular sclerosis scores), all identifiers were removed and scored by an investigator unaware of the hypothesis being tested. Data were then compiled by the primary investigator who had access to the numbering key. Similarly, identifiers were removed from splenic tissue samples and flow cytometry gating and analysis performed by an investigator who was unaware of the hypothesis being tested. No animals or samples were excluded from any end-point analysis. Rats received from a commercial source (2–3 rats per cage) were randomly allocated to either vehicle or treatment, taking care to allocate at least one animal per cage to each group. Following 1 week of recovery, any animal with a mean arterial blood pressure of greater than 130 mmHg on a LS diet was excluded from further analysis according to prespecified exclusion criteria. One rat was excluded from the study using these criteria prior to any end-point analysis. All data from all other animals that entered the study are included in the analysis.

Statistics
Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Inc.) or Microsoft excel (Microsoft corporation, Redmond, WA) software. Blood pressure data were analyzed using two-way repeated measures ANOVA. Multiple comparisons were analyzed using appropriate ANOVA. Specific statistical tests utilized for each analysis are listed in the figure legends. All other comparisons were analyzed via unpaired two-sided Student’s t-test (Microsoft Excel). Significance for all analysis was considered P<0.05.
Effect of high salt diet and NaHCO3 on urinary net acid excretion
HS feeding in Dahl SS rats resulted in increased urinary net acid excretion in rats drinking vehicle, despite the composition of the chow remaining unchanged with the exception of NaCl content (Figure 1). Importantly, this increase in urinary net acid excretion was significantly blunted in rats drinking NaHCO3. Papillary tissue [NH4+] was also significantly reduced in rats drinking NaHCO3 (Figure 1).

Effect of high salt diet and NaHCO3 on plasma electrolytes and blood glucose
Addition of NaHCO3 (0.1 M) to the drinking water of Dahl SS rats had no effect on plasma [HCO3−] or pH at any time during the study when compared with NaCl (0.1 M) (Table 2). HS feeding resulted in a significant decrease in plasma [K] in both groups (P<0.001 (ANOVA)) suggesting that the increased acid excretion in these animals may result from hypokalemia (data not shown). Consistent with previous reports in the Dahl SS rat model [8] indicating Dahl SS rats develop insulin resistance when fed an HS diet, plasma glucose increased with HS feeding in Dahl SS rats however, no significant differences in this trend were observed between NaCl- and NaHCO3-treated rats (Table 2).

Hemodynamics indices in NaCl- and NaHCO3-treated Dahl SS rats fed a high salt diet
NaHCO3 had no significant effect on daily mean arterial pressure (Figure 2) or proteinuria (Figure 2) in Dahl SS rats when compared with vehicle. NaHCO3 increased renal arterial blood velocity when animals were fed LS; however, renal arterial blood velocity increased to similar levels in both vehicle- and NaHCO3-treated animals following initiation of an HS diet (Figure 2).

Renal injury in NaCl- and NaHCO3-treated Dahl SS rats fed a high salt diet
There were no differences in glomerular sclerosis between vehicle- and NaHCO3-treated groups following HS (Figure 2); however, both tubular casts formation (% area: Figure 2) and tissue fibrosis (Sirius Red/green staining: Figure 2) were markedly reduced in NaHCO3 compared with NaCl-treated animals.

Effect of Hv1 and NH4Cl on intracellular pH in isolated perfused mTAL
As we are limited to intracellular measurements using the BCECF-AM dye, to determine whether Hv1 promotes tubular acidification in mTAL of Dahl SS rats, we compared intracellular pH responses in isolated perfused mTAL from wild-type and Hv1−/− rats with and without the presence of NH4+. Consistent with previous observations, addition of NH4Cl to the bath of perfused mTAL resulted in tubular acidification due to the rapid tubular uptake of NH4+ [14]. Acidification was significantly more pronounced in mTAL lacking Hv1 (Figure 3), indicating Hv1 promotes likely H+ efflux, limiting tubular acidification when NH4+ is present.

Blood pressure and proteinuria in wild-type and Hv1−/− Dahl SS rats fed high salt
To determine whether blood pressure responses were similar in untreated wild-type and Hv1−/− rats, we assessed blood pressure and proteinuria in wild-type and Hv1−/− mutant rats with implanted radiotelemetry devices. When measured by 24-h telemetry, blood pressure responses to an HS diet were not different between wild-type and Hv1−/− rats (Figure 4). Further, proteinuria was not different between Hv1−/− and wild-type Dahl SS at any time point measured (Figure 4).

Effect of NaHCO3 on renal cast formation in wild-type and Hv1−/− Dahl SS rats fed high salt
To determine whether NaHCO3 limits cast formation in Dahl SS rats by inactivating Hv1, we compared cast formation in HS fed wild-type and Hv1−/− rats drinking either NaHCO3 or NaCl. Consistent with our other findings, NaHCO3 reduced cast formation in wild-type Dahl SS rats independent of an effect to reduce blood pressure or proteinuria (Figure 5). Importantly, NaHCO3 lowered cast formation by a similar magnitude in both wild-type and Hv1−/− rats (Figure 5).

Relationship between blood pressure and tubular casts
The reduction in tubular cast formation in HS fed Dahl SS rats was independent of blood pressure load, with cast formation in individual NaHCO3-treated rats being lower than that of vehicle-treated rats across a similar range of average daily blood pressures (Figure 2).

Effect of NaHCO3 on inflammation in wild-type and Hv1−/− Dahl SS rats
We have recently reported that oral NaHCO3 ingestion promotes inflammatory (M1) to anti-inflammatory (M2) macrophage polarization in the spleen and kidney of Dahl SS rats, and that changes in macrophage polarization are dependent on the presence of the spleen [22]. Flow cytometry data from whole spleen of both wild-type and Hv1−/− mutant Dahl SS rats treated with either vehicle or NaHCO3 after 2 weeks of HS are presented in Figure 6. NaHCO3 treatment resulted in a significant decrease in TNFα expressing macrophages (M1-polarized “inflammatory” macrophages) and increase in IL-10 expressing macrophages (M2-polarized “anti-inflammatory” macrophages) in the spleen in both wild-type and Hv1−/− mutant rats (Figure 6). Loss of Hv1 promoted a more inflammatory macrophage polarization in the spleen independent of treatment (Figure 6).

As we have shown that removal of the spleen (splenectomy) or breaking of fragile mesothelial connections to the spleen [22] abolished the anti-inflammatory effect of NaHCO3 drinking on the kidney to NaHCO3, in order to determine whether the changes in macrophage polarization were responsible for differences in the cast formation observed, we compared cast formation in Dahl SS rats fed HS for 2 weeks and treated with either NaHCO3 and NaCl following either sham surgery, splenectomy or splenic manipulation. While treatment with NaHCO3 was found to significantly reduce cast formation, we observed similar levels of cast formation between sham, splenectomized, and manipulated spleen groups (Figure 7).

Nephritic proteinuria is an indicator of high glomerular pressure resulting from detrimental renal hemodynamic changes [23]. While to the author’s knowledge, no direct examination of the impact of race on renal protection with NaHCO3 has been reported, the results of the African-American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension Study (AASK Trial) indicated that the association between net endogenous acid production and CKD progression was stronger among those without proteinuria [24]. Interestingly, de Bristo-Ashurst et al. [3] reported oral NaHCO3 markedly reduced GFR decline independent of a similar protective effect to reduce proteinuria or blood pressure in stage 4–5 CKD patients. Further, in a 5-year, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, blinded interventional study of daily oral NaHCO3 versus NaCl in subjects with macroalbuminuric hypertensive nephropathy and CKD stage 2 eGFR (60–90 ml/min), Mahajan et al. [4] reported that NaHCO3 supplementation reduced GFR decline when compared with control subjects receiving NaCl, and that this was independent of a significant effect on either urinary albumin/creatinine ratio or blood pressure. Together, these clinical findings suggest that alkali may slow GFR decline independent of the renal hemodynamic factors that drive proteinuria.

Apolipoprotein L-1 (APO1) gene variants account for much of the increased risk of African-Americans to develop CKD (20). In contrast with patients of European ancestry, or patients lacking APO1 risk variants, evidence in patients of African ancestry with two-risk variants for the APO1 gene indicates that tubular cast formation may be a prominent histological feature in this high CKD risk population (39). These pathological differences highlight the need to understand the varied pathological processes that may result in nephron loss in different populations and led us to investigate whether beneficial effects of NaHCO3 treatment are observed in an experimental model of progressive renal injury that mimics a number of the features observed in African-Americans with CKD including prominent tubular cast formation, the Dahl SS rat model.

The first major finding of the present study is that oral NaHCO3 loading reduced tubular cast formation and renal fibrosis in the Dahl SS rat model independently of blood pressure, renal arterial blood velocity, glomerular injury, or proteinuria (Figure 2). Marked tubular injury and proteinaceous tubular cast formation are a hallmark of injury in the Dahl SS rat model. While numerous stimuli have been reported to reduce tubular cast formation in the SS rat [11,25–53]. To the best of the author’s knowledge, all of these stimuli have also been reported to limit either blood pressure increases in response to a high salt diet or lower proteinuria or glomerular injury. This distinction is important as injury to the glomerular capillaries is generally thought to initiate tubular injury. Multiple mechanisms may contribute to downstream tubular dysfunction following glomerular injury [54]. Kirz and Lehir [54] argue that tubular injury following damage to the glomerular capillaries most commonly results from misdirected filtration in the damaged glomerulus and eventual sensation of tubular flow. While there is debate as to whether excessive filtration of proteins directly damages the downstream tubules [54,55], increased filtration of protein from the damaged glomerulus can contribute to cast formation [12]. Further, partial cessation of single nephron filtration is thought to exacerbate cast formation by prompting a slowly moving filtrate susceptible to protein aggregation. Finally, as the peritubular capillaries that supply the tubular parenchyma arise primarily from the efferent arterioles of the nephrons parent glomerulus, damage to the glomerular capillaries may lead to ischemia of the downstream tubular segments and subsequent tubular hypoxia and injury [56]. Given we did not observe any differences in blood pressure, glomerular injury or proteinuria, our data indicate that reduced tubular cast formation and fibrosis in kidneys from Dahl SS rats treated with HCO3 probably occurred independently of a protective effect on the renal glomeruli.

The hyaline/waxy casts that are observed in CKD are thought to contain a mix uromodulin, a glycol-protein produced exclusively in the thick ascending limb, and precipitates of other proteins [57,58]. Precipitation of filtered proteins within the tubular lumen has been demonstrated to result in loss of renal function in the absence of tubular necrosis and associated cast formation in nephron segments located within the renal medulla and papillary regions [12]. Evidence indicate that these casts are formed primarily by proteins that precipitate out under acidic conditions [12]. While under normal physiological conditions, hyaline cast formation is thought to occur primarily in the collecting duct where urinary pH is lowest [59], protein precipitation may be enhanced in the TAL region in the Dahl SS rat model secondary to glomerular injury and increased luminal fluid protein concentration as well as enhanced reabsorption of Na and Cl in this segment [60]. As NaHCO3 loading increased urinary pH and HCO3 excretion, these stimuli would have increased pH within the luminal fluid of the TAL segment. We hypothesize that this alkalization of the tubular fluid then limited cast formation. To confirm whether alkalization of TAL luminal fluid prevents cast formation in the Dahl SS rat model, we utilized Dahl SS rats in which the Hv1 had been functionally deleted [15]. We previously reported that voltage-gated proton channels are expressed on the apical membrane of the thick ascending limb [15,61]. To confirm that voltage-gated proton channels participate in luminal H+ secretion in the Dahl SS rat model, we compared intracellular pH changes in isolated perfused mTAL from wild-type and Hv1−/− Dahl SS rats in response to NH4Cl. In perfused tubules in which Na is being actively reabsorbed, NH4+ from the surrounding solution is rapidly taken into the cells by NaKATPase by substituting for K+, resulting in cellular acidification [14]. We confirmed that activation of proton channels buffer this response, indicating that in the presence of NH4+, proton channels probably secrete H+ across the apical membrane, a process that would result in reduced pH of the luminal fluid under normal physiological conditions (when NH4+ is present in the luminal and interstitial fluid) and may promote protein precipitation.

To determine whether loss of Hv1 limits cast formation by luminal alkalinization within the TAL segment, we first investigated whether blood pressure responses and proteinuria were similar in untreated wild-type and Hv1−/− Dahl SS fed a high salt diet. Using radiotelemetry, we found no difference in the blood pressure response to a high salt diet in untreated Hv1−/− and wild-type Dahl SS rats (Figure 4). Further, proteinuria was not different at any time point measured (Figure 4). Importantly, in an additional group of rats we confirmed reduced cast formation in Hv1−/− Dahl SS rats when compared with wild-type independent of differences in glomerular injury or proteinuria (Figure 5). Indeed, our finding that both Hv1−/− and NaHCO3-treated Dahl SS rats share the same rare injury phenotype of reduced cast formation independent of proteinuria, glomerular injury or hypertension strongly implicates tubular acidification as the primary mechanism. Our data indicating that oral NaHCO3 provided an additive effect to reduce cast formation in Hv1−/− rats suggests that the effect was mediated by changes in luminal pH rather than other cellular effects related to loss of the proton channel, which would not be mimicked by HCO3 loading, including reduced superoxide production in the TAL [15]. As we have previously shown that Hv1 activity is higher in mTAL from Dahl SS rats when compared with salt-resistant rats [62], excess H+ secretion in this segment may contribute to the development of cast formation and injury in this model.

Our finding that tubular acidification in the thick ascending limb probably drives renal cast formation and fibrosis in the Dahl SS rat model is consistent with evidence that blood pressure elevation and glomerular injury also promote cast formation in the Dahl SS rat [11]. We observe a clear correlation between average daily blood pressure load and cast formation in vehicle-treated Dahl SS rats (Figure 2). As such, we speculate that more acid pH of the luminal fluid within the TAL, as well as increased protein concentration of the tubular fluid driven by glomerular injury and proteinuria (as well as other possible and yet undefined mechanisms), probably acts synergistically to promote cast formation in Dahl SS rats. Pathological tubuloglomerular interactions such as this may explain the large variation in cast formation observed between renal injury models with similar levels of glomerular injury, proteinuria, and GFR decline. This tubular component (cast formation) of injury probably acts synergistically with other classical pathways including barotrauma to promote nephron injury and loss. As blood pressure and glomerular injury were not different in our study, these (non-cast) mechanisms probably contributed equally to renal injury in both NaCl- and NaHCO3-treated rats over the relatively short time course of our study. If, over longer periods, cast formation promoted greater loss of nephrons in NaCl-treated animals, however, we would expect to see injury from these classical mechanisms be enhanced secondary to greater nephron loss.

While precipitation of proteins and tubular cast formation has been associated with renal functional decline in other models [12,63], and we observed a positive association between cast formation and tubular interstitial fibrosis in our studies (Figure 2), whether cast formation due to enhanced precipitation of luminal proteins contributes significantly to GFR decline in the Dahl SS rat model remains unclear. In our hands, GFR does not decline significantly in Dahl SS rats fed a high salt diet for as long as 4 weeks, and rats normally die of stroke secondary to development of malignant hypertension when maintained on high salt diets for longer periods. Long-term studies in nephrectomized wild-type and Hv1−/− Dahl SS rats fed relatively low salt diets, or similar long-term studies in wild-type Dahl SS rats utilizing NaHCO3 and NaCl loading in which blood pressures are maintained below malignant levels, may allow us to determine whether differences in cast formation can contribute to GFR decline independent of proteinuria in Dahl SS rats.

Recent clinical studies support an important role of dysfunction of tubular origin in the progression of CKD. Numerous clinical studies have demonstrated that rare missense mutations in UMOD result in autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney diseases manifest by tubulointerstitial fibrosis, tubular casts, and a rapid progression to renal failure [64]. A model in which primary tubular dysfunction promotes GFR decline is also consistent with findings in CKD patients which NaHCO3 slowed GFR decline in the absence of a detectable effect on proteinuria [3,4]. That is, by blocking tubular flow, cast formation may reduce GFR independently of glomerular injury/barotrauma and increased proteinuria. While further investigation is required to examine this hypothesis, if it is confirmed, NaHCO3 may represent a particularly useful therapeutic to reduce cast formation and GFR decline in patients with prominent cast formation, including those of African ancestry with APO1 risk variants and UAKD.

Our finding that the blood pressure response in Dahl SS rats did not differ between NaHCO3- and NaCl-treated rats is somewhat surprising given previous reports that non-chloride anions do not promote the same degree of hypertension in this model (25). We speculate that because, in addition to NaHCO3 intake in the drinking water, our animals were fed a high salt chow (8%) chloride intake was sufficient to promote a hypertensive response in our experiments despite a portion of the dietary salt load coming from NaHCO3. In any event, blood pressure was measured across the entire protocol by telemetry, so we are confident that we can rule of any effects that could be attributed to BP differences between our NaCl- and NaHCO3-treated groups.

We have recently reported that oral NaHCO3 promotes an anti-inflammatory phenotype in rats which is dependent on the presence of the spleen including both splenic and renal M1 (inflammatory) to M2 (regulatory) polarization. Evidence from preclinical studies suggests a deleterious effect of inflammatory cytokines on renal function and injury [42]. A potentially significant source of inflammatory cytokines in the kidney is circulating macrophages. Consistent with our prior observations, in the current study, oral NaHCO3 loading was associated with M1 to M2 polarization of splenic macrophages. Either prior manipulation or complete removal of the spleen, which completely abolished the anti-inflammatory effect of oral NaHCO3 however, had no effect to prevent the protective effects of oral NaHCO3 on either cast formation or fibrosis in the Dahl SS model. Further, inflammatory macrophage polarization was greater in Dahl SS rats lacking Hv1, yet cast formation and fibrosis in the kidney were lower than in wild-type rats (Figure 7). These data indicate that anti-inflammatory macrophage polarization does not to underlie the protective effect of NaHCO3 on cast formation and fibrosis we observed in the Dahl SS rat model.

​
Clinical perspectives
This study was undertaken to determine whether NaHCO3 was protective against renal injury in the Dahl SS rat model. We found that NaHCO3 limits cast formation and renal fibrosis in Dahl salt-sensitive rats independent of blood pressure, glomerular injury, and hypertension. This protective effect is mediated by luminal alkalization within the TAL segment, where tubular cast formation is most prominent.

These data are significant because, while there is some disagreement [56], utilizing the remnant kidney model, a number of reports have indicated a beneficial effect of alkali loading on the kidney including both reductions in proteinuria and the rate of GFR decline [65,66]. These effects have been attributed to a number of physiological mechanisms including reduced renal angiotensin II [67], reduced complement activation [65], and reduced endothelin levels [68].

By demonstrating NaHCO3 limits cast formation, our data provide an additional and novel potential mechanism through which alkali loading may slow renal injury progression independent of glomerular hemodynamic changes and proteinuria in CKD patients. This mechanism is consistent with clinical findings and may be of particular relevance to CKD populations in which tubular casts are a prominent histological finding.

Bioactive glasses (BGs) are being increasingly considered for biomedical applications. One convenient approach to utilize BGs in tissue engineering and drug delivery involves their combination with organic biomaterials in order to form composites with enhanced biocompatibility and biodegradability. In this work, mesoporous bioactive glass nanoparticles (MBGN) have been merged with polyhydroxyalkanoate microspheres with the purpose to develop drug carriers. The composite carriers (microspheres) were loaded with curcumin as a model drug. The toxicity and delivery rate of composite microspheres were tested in vitro, reaching a curcumin loading efficiency of over 90% and an improving of biocompatibility of different concentrations of MBGN due to its administrations through the composite. The composite microspheres were tested in terms of controlled release, biocompatibility and bioactivity. Our results demonstrate that the composite microspheres can be potentially used in biomedicine due to their dual effects: bioactivity (due to the presence of MBGN) and curcumin release capability.

Keywords: bioactive glass nanoparticles, composite microspheres, drug delivery systems, PHBV
Biomaterials to be used in dental and orthopedic applications should exhibit the ability to form a strong bond with bone tissue and to promote bone growth. Bioactive glasses (BGs) exhibit the formation of hydroxyapatite on their surfaces when in contact with body fluids, which has been considered to induce osteoconductivity and strong bonding to bone tissue [1,2,3,4]. Macro devices based on these biomaterials have been studied since the last decade on different surgical and biomedical applications. However, recently, new processes have been explored to produce some nano structures such as mesoporous bioactive glass nanoparticles (MBGN), nanofibers, among others, in order to enhance BGs bioactivity and to expand the applications in the nanomedicine [5,6]. In this context, the combination of MBGN with different biomaterials at the micro and nanoscale is gaining increasing attention for applications ranging from tissue engineering to drug delivery systems [7,8,9,10]. However, the assimilation of MBGN in biological environments has resulted in being difficult for certain concentrations. Some authors have reported the rapid exchange of ions between the MBGN and the aqueous medium, which may result in a rapid and undesired increase of the pH of the medium [11,12]; this could make the biocompatibility and assimilation of MBGN in biological environments difficult. Another possible cause of these effects could be due to the interaction presented between nanoparticles and cells, in which the contact with the cell membrane is different than with devices of bigger sizes; this can also be considered an important cause of the side effects observed. Then, a suitable approach to damping these possible effects is the combination of MBGN, and BGs, in general, with other biomaterials [7,8,9,10]. Specifically, composite structures such as films and coatings for 3D scaffolds have been developed in the last few years [10,13,14,15].

Due to their high biocompatibility and biodegradation, polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) have been widely utilized in the fabrication of different biomedical devices, such as films, three-dimensional scaffolds, micro and nano particles, and polymer-based drug carriers [16]. Specifically, the use of PHAs as drug delivery systems has been previously explored for the fabrication of micro and nanoparticles for the loading and release of different substances, antibiotics and natural extracts (phytotherapeutics) [17,18,19,20,21,22]. In this field, a particular phytoherapeutic, curcumin, has exhibited a series of attractive properties such as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in addition to being favorable for wound healing [23,24]. There are some reports about the successful entrapment and release of curcumin by micro and nanoparticles made of various materials, PHAs, among others [22,25,26].

In this work, poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV), a member of the PHA family, was combined with MBGN at different ratios to form composite microspheres which were loaded with curcumin. The biocompatibility of the composite microspheres was assessed by cell culture studies, and the release rate of curcumin and the bioactivity of the microspheres were investigated.
2.1. Microsphere Size and Zeta Potential
The average diameter of the composite microspheres developed in this work was 2.1 ± 0.3 µm (Figure 1). No significant difference between composite microspheres and blank PHBV microspheres (not containing MBGN) was found. In addition, the size was found to be similar to previous reports on PHA based microspheres fabricated by using similar emulsion techniques [13,22,27,28]. On the other hand, the size of MBGN (Figure 1) was 177 ± 13 nm, also similar to values previously reported in literature [6,29,30].

An important aspect in the use of particles as drug carriers is its capacity to remain homogenous and disperse in liquid environments. One of the properties that impacts this behavior is the Zeta potential of the particles, which can promote the repealing or the attraction of the particles in different environments. The Zeta potential of the composite microspheres was −14.30 ± 1.33 mV (measured in PBS at pH: 7.5), which indicates that the fabricated microspheres should not tend to agglomerate in aqueous environments similar to PBS. Pure PHBV microspheres and MGBN samples were measured exhibiting a zeta potential of −4.58 ± 0.14 mV and −13.13 ± 0.4 mV, respectively.

2.2. Surface Morphology of Composite Microspheres
Homogeneity on the spherical shape of the composite microspheres was observed for the PHVB/MGBN ratios of 90:10, 80:20, and 70:30. A similar morphology was observed in pure PHBV microspheres. Typical micrographs are compared in Figure 2a,b. For these three conditions, the shape of microspheres was not affected by the incorporation of MBGN. However, for higher MBGN ratios (60:40 and 50:50), the morphology was modified and, apparently, as the MBGN ratio increased, it exceeded the capacity of the PHBV to form the microsphere matrix adequately. Examples of this can be observed in Figure 2c in which some microspheres showed MBGN aggregation outside the PHBV matrix and, in Figure 2b, where a portion of the MBGN was even observed dispersed around the microspheres and not fully covered by the PHBV matrix.

2.3. Composition Analysis
Figure 3 shows the FTIR spectrum of the composite microspheres at the 70:30 PHBV/MBGN ratio. The pattern exhibits peaks at 455 cm−1 and 1067 cm−1, which correspond to Si–O–Si stretching and Si–O–Si bending modes, respectively, present in the MBGN [6]. However, peaks may possibly overlap with the more intense spectra of the PHBV. The peak at 1731 cm−1 indicates the stretching mode of C=O in the crystalline phase of PHBV. In addition, the peaks at 1282 cm−1 and 1179 cm−1 correspond to the crystalline and the amorphous parts via the stretching modes of C–O–C present in PHBV. On the other hand, the peaks at 817 cm−1 and the peak at 3509 cm−1 correspond to the vibrations of -CH bonds and the O-H stretch, respectively, both characteristic in curcumin. As in the MBGN case, these peaks may be overlapped by the spectra of PHBV. However, the band around 3400 cm−1, due to the stretching of hydrogen bonded -OH groups present in curcumin, was clearly observed [31,32,33]. Due to the fact that no new functional groups in the FTIR spectrum were detected, it is possible to consider that the composite is simply a blend of the different components without the formation of any other intermediate phase. This result is similar to previous reports using the same materials [13,34].

To support the composition of the composite, the XRD diffractogram of composite microspheres at 70:30 PHBV/MBGN ratio is shown in Figure 4. The characteristic peak of crystalline curcumin present at 2Ɵ 26.5° can be observed [35]. However, the peak for curcumin at 14.3° and the amorphous structure of MBGN at 2Ɵ 23.1° may also be overlapped by the more intense PHBV spectrum, from which several characteristic peaks at 2Ɵ 13.4°, 16.9°, 21.3°, 22.4°, 26° and 27° are clearly observed [6,35]. Similar results have been reported in previous studies involving some of these materials [13,34].

2.4. Curcumin Entrapment Efficiency
Figure 5 shows the curcumin entrapment efficiency (CEE) of the different microspheres fabricated. It was observed that the incorporation of MBGN at the different ratios studied in this work apparently did not affect the entrapment of curcumin at the PHBV/curcumin ratio of 90:10. The CEE was similar and around 90% for all the conditions studied. This indicates that, as expected, curcumin can be entrapped by the PHBV/MBGN composite and processed through emulsion techniques, at least under the MBGN ratios studied in this work.

2.5. Curcumin Release Kinetics in PBS
One of the advantages of using PHA-based micro particles as a drug carrier is the possibility of controlling and prolonging the drug release [17,22]. Figure 6 shows the curcumin release kinetics of the 90:10 (PHBV/MBGN) sample in PBS. The curve exhibits a typical release behavior similar to that reported in previous studies [17,22,36,37].

2.6. In Vitro Cell Culture Assays
As previously mentioned, one aim of this work is to reduce possible side effects due to different concentrations of MBGN in biological environments, by incorporating MBGN into a PHBV matrix and by adding curcumin. The comparison of the cell viability, at two different time points, between the composite microspheres and free MBGN was used to determine a possible side effect due to the high reactivity of MBGN. To this purpose, we compared the cell viability, after 24 h and 7 days of incubation, respectively (Figure 7 and Figure 8). The free MBGN condition was calculated to contain similar concentrations of MBGN to that in the highest ratio in the composite microspheres (50:50).

Figure 8
Fluorescence micrographs of MG-63 cells treated with (a) composite microspheres at 50:50 (PHBV/MBGN) ratio and a (b) similar amount of free MBGN after 24 h (bar size is 10 µm).

In Figure 7, it is possible to observe a similar cell viability between the experiments carried out with 90:10 and 80:20 MBGN ratios and the control. This was more evident in 10−2 and 10−3 dilutions. However, in samples with the highest MBGN ratio (50:50), only in 10−2 and 10−3 dilutions was the cell viability similar to the control in the first 24 h. In contrast, samples treated with free MBGN exhibited a cell viability considerably lower compared to the control. This was also observed between the 10−1 dilution of the highest ratio of MBGN (50:50) condition and the control.

In addition, fluorescent microscopy observations were used to analyze the proliferation and morphology of the cells after exposure to the composite microspheres and MBGN. Blue staining represents the cell nuclei and red staining represents the cell cytoplasm. Figure 8 shows the fluorescent micrographs of cells treated with the highest dilution of microspheres at 50:50 PHBV/MBGN ratio (Figure 8a) and cells treated with the same dilution of free MBGN (control) (Figure 8b), both after 24 h of incubation. In Figure 8a, the sample treated with composite microspheres, most of the cells exhibited a classical reported morphology (colonies conformed by homogeneous flat and spread cells). On the other hand, Figure 8b shows that cells have different morphology (smaller and less spread cells, with heterogeneous morphology and apparent low cell–matrix attachment surface, compared to control analysis), possibly due to damage caused by the direct exposure to the free MBGN, and/or changes of pH produced by these scaffolds.

Figure 9 shows the cell viability after seven days of incubation. In this time set, the cell viability of samples treated with free MBGN decreased considerably in comparison to the control. In contrast, most of the samples treated with composite microspheres (90:10, 80:20 and most of the dilution folds at 70:30) exhibited similar cell viability to the control.

Fluorescent microscopy analysis was developed after this time lapse of exposure to the composite and free MBGN. Figure 10 shows an image of cells treated with a dilution of microspheres at 50:50 PHBV/MBGN ratio, and the corresponding amount of free MBGN dilution after seven days of incubation.

Figure 10a shows the presence of a higher number of living cells with respect to control experiments, which was determined based on the qualitative analysis of stained nuclei. On the other hand, Figure 10b shows a qualitatively lower population of living cells, based on less presence of nuclei. In addition, seeded cells showed a heterogeneous and irregular morphology, compared to control experiments. These observations can be explained due to the long exposure to a high concentration of free MBGN microspheres.

2.7. Bioactivity Assessment
Finally, bioactivity assays were carried out involving the characterization of the formation of hydroxyapatite (HA) on the surface of the microspheres after immersion in SBF. For this assay, the condition with the lowest proportion of MBGN (90:10) was selected. Figure 11a shows a specific section of composite microsphere diffractograms before (i.e., yellow curve) and after seven days (i.e., blue curve) being immersed in SBF.

Figure 11
(a) XRD patterns of composite microspheres PHBV/MBGN (90:10) after zero and seven days of immersion in SBF, and (b) SEM micrograph of composite microspheres (same ratio) after seven days of immersion in SBF.

As these figures show, some of the peaks related to the semi crystalline phase of hydroxyapatite appeared at 2Ɵ 29° and 32°, agreeing to similar previous literature reported [6,13,14,34,38]. In the case of the composite microspheres, calcium ions released from the MBGN likely interact with the ions present in the SBF, promoting the formation of hydroxyapatite on the surface of the microspheres.

The formation of this layer on the surface of the composite microspheres was confirmed by SEM observations after seven days of immersion in SBF (Figure 11b). The morphology is similar to previous observations during the formation of hydroxyapatite on BG-based structures [6,30,38]. Thus, both characterization methods confirmed the bioactivity of the composite microspheres at the lowest MBGN content (90:10) studied in this work.
3.1. Microsphere Size and Z-Potential
When using biomaterial-based carriers in drug delivery, the particle size may modify the interaction with cells [22,39]. Thus, depending on the application field, the particle size could exhibit advantages or disadvantages. For example, it has been observed that smaller particles could damage the cell membrane [40], while large particles show restrictions during endocytosis [22]. Due to the size of MBGN (177 ± 13 nm), in addition to the characteristic release of cations, a rapid change on the pH could appear, and these can produce cytotoxic effects in biological environments [11,12]. In contrast, the composite microspheres (2.1 ± 0.3 µm) will interact with the cell membrane in a different way, and such microspheres have a suitable size, which should enable them to enter into blood vessels without causing hemodynamic problems.

For the different MGBN ratios used in the fabrication of the composite microspheres, an apparent saturation limit of MBGN embedded in the PHBV matrix can be observed. Furthermore, as the MBGN ratio increased, the composite particles lost their spherical shape and homogeneity (Figure 2c,d). This can be the result of differences in the material chemical composition, which impacts hydrophobicity and affects its affinity [41,42]. However, most of the PHBV/MBGN ratios studied in this work (90:10, 80:20 and 70:30) exhibited a good integration of the MBGN into well-formed PHBV microspheres. Composition analysis of the composite microspheres supports the non-reactive interaction of MBGN and PHBV similar to previous reports [10,13,14,15].

Another desirable characteristic for particulate drug carriers is the possibility to obtain homogeneously dispersed particles in a liquid carrier. Each component of the present microspheres has been studied extensively in previous works, and differences in zeta potential, hydrophobicity and affinity with aqueous media have been reported [41,42,43]. The zeta potential of the composite microspheres indicates that their agglomeration may be hindered in aqueous environments similar to blood. These characteristics ensure the uniformity of properties and stability of the composite microspheres to be applied as drug carriers in biological environments.

3.2. Composite Microspheres as Drug Delivery Systems
For its application as drug delivery system, it is important that the carrier is physiochemically compatible with the drug to be loaded. A model drug is commonly defined as the component that can be measured/traced once released from the device [22]. The compatibility depends on many factors, such as the hydrophobicity of drug and carrier, the solubility of the drug in the solvent used for the carrier fabrication, the stability of the drug during the fabrication process, among others [22]. In this work, curcumin was selected as a model drug due to its beneficial properties, useful in this application, and its compatibility with the organic solvent used in the fabrication of the microspheres [23,24]. Curcumin has been successfully entrapped in different biomaterials with controlled release purposes [19,25,26]. In contrast to other drugs, such as gentamicin, which has exhibited low compatibility with PHAs in the past (i.e., having an entrapment efficiency below to 50%), curcumin has been reported to have good compatibility and entrapment efficiency in PHA matrices [18,19,22].

Tailoring drug release behavior is important since a controlled drug release can allow prolonged treatments with reduced administration of the drug, with the purpose of decreasing potential side effects due to the presence of high drug concentrations in plasma during the early stages of treatment. The curcumin release kinetic of composite microspheres (Figure 6) exhibited a biphasic behavior in which the first phase, the so-called “burst” phase, appeared during the first 5 h approximately. The appearance of this phase can be explained, as previously reported [17,22], due to the interaction of the medium with the surface of microspheres and the relation between volume, size and surface area. As it has been reported, the rate of release is influenced by the size of the particles [18,22].

The next phase, the “controlled release phase”, appeared after approximately 5 h and continued until 20 h in the present experiment. After 25 h, measurements at random periods of time were taken with no significant changes in concentrations observed. This release behavior was similar to previously reported results using PHA based microspheres as drug release systems [17,22,36,37]. The CEE (over 90% in all cases) and the release kinetic curve showed the potential of the composite microspheres for achieving prolonged release, as a delay of the maximum curcumin concentration was observed during the first 10 h. The release kinetics depends on many factors, such as the morphology of the microspheres and the drug solubility in the environment, among others. Then, the release kinetics may be modified by varying these factors and the possibility for entrapping other pythotherapeutics and even to combine inorganic/hydrophilic components with organic/hydrophobic components through the same matrix could be explored in further studies.

3.3. Cytocompatibility of Composite Microspheres
The adequate incorporation of MBGN into the PHBV matrix modifies the interaction between the composite and the cells in most of the ratios studied. The PHBV matrix serves as an interface which moderates the release and the direct contact of MBGN with the cell culture medium. This effect could avoid high initial MBGN concentrations in the biological environment and, due to the size of the microspheres, it provides a contact interaction which reduces the possible side effects of MBGN directly exposed to cells [11,12,18,40]. This is supported by the trend of cell viability observed in the WST-8 results through the different ratios studied in this work. Additional information is provided for the first time by the analysis of the fluorescent microscopy images, in which the samples treated with composite microspheres (Figure 8a and Figure 10a) exhibited a larger group of healthy cells, in terms of the number of nuclei observed, and the cell morphology and proliferation patterns presented in these samples, indicating a more viable interaction for the cells due to the composite. This in contrast to the observations in cell samples treated with similar amounts of free MBGN (Figure 8b and Figure 10b), which showed abnormal patterns of cell proliferation and morphology.

Although at higher MGBN concentrations the cell viability was lower compared to the control, or even in the presence of microspheres containing lower MBGN concentrations (i.e., 90:10 and 80:20), significant differences between the living cell population could be observed by the WST-8 viability results. This, in combination with the fluorescent microscopy observations, brings evidence of a clear different behavior in vitro, between free MBGN and similar amounts of MBGN but administrated through microspheres. There is still ongoing discussion about what phenomena, the pH change due to the rapid release of ions or the effect of size of the nanoparticles in the interaction with cells, have a bigger impact on the reduction of the cell viability due to free MBGN.

Additionally, even though a study to measure the effect of curcumin on cells was not performed in this work, the slight difference observed between the WST-8 cell viability on samples treated with only PHBV and the composite microspheres (Figure 7 and Figure 9), showed that the beneficial properties of curcumin [23,24] may play a role in the damping of possible side effects due to the presence of (high concentrations of) MBGN. The morphology and proliferation behavior observed in cells treated with composite microspheres could also be explained due to the release of curcumin. In almost all the conditions studied for the composite microspheres, the cell viability was higher than in its respective dilution of free MBGN. Finally, the formation of a layer of hydroxyapatite on the surface of microspheres, even for the condition with the lowest MBGN ratio (90:10), after contact with SBF, confirmed the bioactivity of the composites microspheres, which is the result of the exchange of ions from the composite to the medium. A little difference observed between the surface morphology of the hydroxyapatite layer formed on the microspheres in comparison to the layer formed on MBGN after similar time lapses may indicate an initial stage of hydroxyapatite layer formation in the case of the composite microspheres. This could be explained due to the interaction with NBGN, and SBF is delayed by the PHBV polymer matrix. In correspondence to this, composite samples with higher MBGN ratios will exhibit a higher ion exchange and less delay on the formation of the hydroxyapatite layer, indicating the potential of the composite microspheres to induce local mineralization.

Furthermore, ethyl acetate, cetyl-trimethylammonium bromide [CTAB] were provided from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany), ammonium hydroxide 28% from VWR (Fontenay Sous Bois, France), distilled water (MilliQ), and absolute ethanol–99.8% from Alfa Aesar (Kandel, Germany). All chemicals used were of an analytical grade.

4.2. Synthesis of MBGN
The mesoporous bioactive glass nanoparticles were produced by using a modified Stöber procedure as reported by Nawaz et al. [6]. Briefly, 0.56 g of CTAB was dissolved in 26 mL of water and stirred for 15 min. Then, 8 mL of ethyl acetate was dropped carefully into the CTAB solution. Afterwards, 3 mL of TEOS were added under continuous stirring; then, ammonium hydroxide was added to maintain the pH at 10.5. Later, calcium nitrate and TEP were added carefully to the solution and then allowed for reacting under stirring for 3 h. Finally, the suspension was centrifugated at 7000 rpm in a 5430R from Eppendorf (Hamburg, Germany) for 10 min and washed with ultrapure water three times. The precipitates were dried in an oven at 60 °C overnight and then calcinated at 700 °C with a heating rate of 2 °C/min for 5 h.

4.3. Composite Microsphere Fabrication
For the fabrication of microspheres, a modified solid in oil in water emulsion (S/O/W) method was used, similarly to the technique reported in previous works [18,22]. Different amounts of MBGN were added into the PHBV solution in 10 mL dichloromethane. In this work, the concentrations of MGBN in the PHBV microspheres started at 10% (w/w) and increased gradually by 10% until reaching 50% (w/w) to obtain five PHBV/MBGN ratios of 90:10, 80:20, 70:30, 60:40 and 50:50 (w/w). Then, curcumin was loaded in all conditions at 90:10 (w/w) (PHBV/curcumin) ratio and mixed at 800 rpm to form the S/O phase. An aqueous solution of 1 mg/mL of PVA was prepared and mixed at 600 rpm to conform the W phase. The resulting solution was mixed at 19,000 rpm using a homogenizer T18 (IKA, Staufen, Germany). Afterwards, the emulsion was centrifuged and washed with ultrapure water twice, and the supernatant was completely removed. The microspheres precipitated were dried in an incubator at 60° for overnight and then stored protected from the light.

4.4. Curcumin Entrapment Efficiency
The Curcumin Entrapment Efficiency (CEE) was determined according to the supernatant method previously reported [22,44]. Briefly, microsphere samples were immersed in ethanol and then supernatant curcumin concentration was measured through a UV/Vis spectrophotometer Specord 250 (Analytikjena, Jena, Germany) at 425 nm. The entrapped efficiency was calculated by using the following equation:

CEE=(Mthe−Msup)(100%)Mthe
(1)
where Msup is the mass of curcumin measured in the supernatant (mg), and Mthe is the theoretical initial mass of curcumin added during the fabrication of the samples (mg).

4.5. Microsphere Surface Morphology
The surface morphology of the composite microspheres was observed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) using a microscope Auriga (Zeiss, Munich, Germany). The microspheres were sputter coated with gold in a turbomolecular pumped coater Q150T Plus (Quorum, Laughton, UK), prior to SEM examination.

4.6. Microspheres Size and Zeta Potential Analysis
The size average measurements of the composite microspheres, MBGN and blank PHBV particles were performed by using a Zetasizer NanoZS (Marlvern, Worcestershire, UK) in deionized water. The zeta potential measurements of composite microspheres were carried out by suspending samples in PBS at pH: 7.5, MGBN and blank PHBV in deionized water.

4.7. Structural Characterization of Composite Microspheres
The structural characterization of the composite microspheres was determined through FTIR by using a Nicolet 6700 Thermo Scientific FTIR spectrometer (Waltham, MA, USA). Measurements were carried out in absorbance mode at wavenumber range from 4000 to 400 cm−1 at a resolution of 4 cm−1. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed by using an X-ray diffractometer D8 advance Brucker (Billerica, MA, USA) in the range of 10° to 80° 2Ɵ with a step size of 0.01° and dwell time of 1° per minute.

4.8. Bioactivity Assessment
Samples of microspheres at a 10:1 ratio of PHBV/MBGN were immersed in Simulated Body Fluid (SBF) for 7 days. SBF was produced according to the protocol of Kokubo [45]. Then, SBF was removed, and microsphere samples were stored and dried at room temperature for examination. The surface morphology of samples was analyzed as in Section 4.5. The XRD analysis of microsphere were performed by using X-ray diffractometer D8 advance Brucker (Billerica, MA, USA) in the range of 2Ɵ 26° to 39° with a step size of 0.01° and dwell time of 1° per minute.

4.9. Curcumin Release Kinetics
For the curcumin release kinetics, 10 mg of composite microspheres were placed in sterile falcon tubes with caps by triplicates. Then, 10 mL of Phosphate Buffer Solution (PBS) at pH = 7.4 (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) was added into each falcon tube and stored at room temperature. The release kinetic curve was obtained in accordance with previously reported methods [19,22] by using the spectrophotometer Specord 250 (Analytikjena, Jena, Germany) at 425 nm.

4.10. Cell Culture Assays
Human osteoblasts like MG-63 cells (sourced from the Biomaterials Institute cell bank) were grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco, Dreieich, Germany). In addition, 50,000 cells were seeded on 24 well-plates and incubated for 12 h before performing the biocompatibility tests.

Master solutions of 1.0 mg/mL of composite microspheres (from each PHBV/MBGN ratios), PHBV microspheres without loading and free MBGN were prepared. Afterwards, ten-fold serial dilutions (10, 100 and 1000 µL) from each master solution were added to the 24 plates already containing seeded cells. Experiments were carried out in triplicate. The cell viability was assessed after 24 h and 7 days post treatment by WST-8 assays (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) according to the provider instructions. Briefly, the well-plates’ supernatant was removed and washed with PBS; then, a freshly prepared cell culture medium was added containing 1.0% v/v WST-8 solution, followed by incubation for 2 h. Subsequently, 100 µl of supernatant from each well-plate was transferred into a 96 well-plate for absorbance measurement at 450 nm in a PHOmo Autobio (Labtec Instruments, Zhengzhou, China).

4.11. Cell Staining
Samples were treated with Fluorescent DNA stain (DAPI) and Vybrant DyeCycle staining (both reagents from Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) for observation in a microscope AxioCam ERc 5s Primovert (Zeiss, Munich, Germany), after 24 h and after 7 days of incubation. Images were analyzed by using the open-source software Fiji (ImageJ, Bethesda, MD, USA).

4.12. Statistical Analysis
Data were presented as the mean ± standard deviation of each treatment. Data were analyzed for statistical significance using the analysis of variance One-Way ANOVA followed by Tukey test (p < 0.05), using software Origin 8 (OriginLab, Northampton, MA, USA).
In this work, the combination of MBGN, curcumin and PHBV as a composite drug delivery system was successfully investigated. The composite microspheres exhibited an average diameter of 2.10 ± 0.27 µm, spherical uniform shape and a semi-homogeneous distribution under certain MBGN concentrations. The zeta potential values in PBS indicated that composite microspheres should not tend to agglomerate in aqueous environments with pH similar to blood. The curcumin entrapment efficiency was around 90%, and it was not affected by the incorporation of MBGN in the ratios studied. The curcumin release kinetics showed signs of a gradual release, and the presence of bioactivity was confirmed by immersion tests in SBF. The in vitro results exhibited a significant difference between the biocompatibility of samples treated with the composite microspheres compared to the ones treated with free MBGN. This indicates a reduction of the possible side effects, due to rapid alkalinization of the medium by MBGN and effects of the interaction between cells and nanoparticles, when they are administered through the composite microspheres. The cell compatibility was measured at two different time points and was supported by WST-8 additional evidence about the behavior of cells due to the presence of particles being developed by fluorescent microscopy. The results confirmed a different cell viability when comparing the administration of similar amounts of free MBGN and composite microspheres. Fluorescent observations provided information for the first time about the behavior of composite microspheres and high ratios of free MBGN in contact with the cells. The potential of the composite microspheres as a drug delivery system was also confirmed. The present composite microspheres are in principle suitable for applications in which both curcumin drug release and bioactivity are required, such as in bone surgical procedures or in the development of bone regeneration therapies where curcumin and the presence of hydroxyapatite can act to promote bone healing and bone tissue formation. However, long-term cell biology studies are required for the further development of these devices and to consider their applications in bone regeneration approaches.
